They also enlisted the help of police officers in charge of guarding the embassy and of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nTakeover\n\nAt 6:30 AM on November 4th, 1979, protestors, with the organization of some ringleaders, managed to cut in and break into the US embassy, eventually taking it over.\nIslamists in Iran rounded up most of the absent embassy workers and returned them to the embassy, with some workers managing to take refuge in the British, Swedish, or Canadian embassy.\n\nSix American diplomats were smuggled out of Iran on January 28th, 1980, in a joint Canadian-CIA operation known as the Canadian Caper\n\n\nInitially, the demands from the students were for the return of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi from the US (where he was being treated for cancer), and for the United States to apologize for meddling in Iran’s affairs in the 1953 overthrow of the Prime Minister, Mosaddegh.\nDocuments were taken from inside the embassy and selectively published to portray America as planning some sort of interference with internal Iranian affairs, although it seems unlikely this was ever being planned or considered.\nInternal factions in Iran used the union around the hostage situation to strengthen their positions inside the country, eventually leading to the adoption of a theocratic constitution and the purging of more moderate elements after the end of the hostage crisis.\nThe United States claims many external players were implicated in the takeover, including the Soviets, Cuba, Libya, and East Germany.\n\nDocuments from the Embassy\n\nIran published collections of documents found in the embassy in a series of books, titled Documents from the U.S. Espionage Den\n\nThe 444-day crisis\n\nThe hostage-takers released women and minorities first, after declaring solidarity with “oppressed minorities.”\nYasser Arafat traveled to Tehran and assisted with the release of 13 other hostages.\nThe hostages endured general mistreatment as prisoners.\n\nOutcome\nImportant Notes\n\nSignificantly deteriorated US-Iran relations.\nConsidered a major contributor to Carter’s presidential downfall.\n"},"2021.01.06---January-6th-Insurrection":{"title":"2021.01.06 - January 6th Insurrection","links":["/","tags/StopTheSteal"],"tags":["StopTheSteal"],"content":"Sources\n\n@realDonaldTrump, tweet calling on his fans to protest the election on 2012-11-06.\n@realDonaldtrump, tweet claiming America wasn’t a Democracy after Obama won the election\n\n2012-11-06.\n\n\nCBS Miami, “Donald Trump Accuses Ted Cruz Of Fraud In Iowa, Calls For New Election”\n\n2016-02-03.

Electoral Process\nDonald Trump made statements about the election being rigged even prior to his 2016 election, and continually called for the complete and total ban on mail-in ballots. ABC News catalogued a lot of the false election claims, and I’ve included some below.\nForeknowledge of Disparate Attitudes Towards Mail-in Voting\n10 states allowed early voting via mail as early as September for the 2020 election. Donald Trump was making multiple claims of voter fraud via mail-in ballots, which Democrats were known to utilize in greater numbers than Republicans, despite Trump having absolutely no evidence of said voter fraud and despite  counting having not even yet begun and no numbers being published.\n\n\n                  \n                   Dominion v Fox News pages 18-19\n                  \n                \n\nNot surprisingly, given these trends, the head of the Fox News Decision Desk correctly predicted that “on election night, we may be looking at states where it seems that President Trump is in the lead, but there’s still 20 or 30 percent of the vote outstanding … so we’re not [going to be] able to make the call in those states.” He correctly recognized—and Fox widely and repeatedly reported before the election—that this would occur because President Trump had criticized mail-in voting and encouraged Republicans to vote in person whereas Democrats had encouraged their supporters to vote by mail. In fact, Maria Bartiromo discussed this very phenomenon with President Trump in an October 11, 2020 interview, with President Trump lamenting that mail-in votes would likely be counted “two weeks after the vote comes in,” and stating that “Republicans are going out to vote—they don’t want to do the [mail-in] ballot thing, they don’t trust it. Republicans are going out to vote.”\n\n\nFox News was also complicit in the process, helping Trump fabricate and prepare to push lies in the event that he lost the election.\n\n\n                  \n                  The Daily Beast, Fox News Pushes ‘Brain Room’ to Find Evidence for Trump’s Voter Fraud Claims, Insiders Say on October 31st, 2020\n                  \n                \n\n“Officially, it looks like an attempt to report on election irregularities. What it feels like is an attempt to push more baseless conspiracy theories and scare the viewers into thinking the election is being ‘stolen.’ It isn’t,” one Fox News veteran with direct knowledge of the Election Integrity Project, told The Daily Beast. “It’s alarming that the Brain Room is a part of this, like it’s an attempt to give it an air of legitimacy. I don’t recall ever seeing anything like this before.”\nThis person added: “It feels like an attempt to use the Brain Room to try to lend credibility to something that isn’t credible. It feels like a stunt to support Trump’s baseless allegations that the Democrats are trying to ‘steal’ the election. If it is a collection or database of alleged voter fraud examples, I could see it being used to support Trump’s efforts to contest the election results, if Biden wins.”\nA second Fox News staffer—who, like other current employees quoted in this story, asked not to be further identified for fear of retaliation—said the Election Integrity Project “seems a logical effort to collect information about mail-in ballots that could skew the results… Fox clearly wants to portray mailed-in ballots in the most negative light, since Democrats favor it and Trump’s re-election, if polls are to be believed this time around, is not at all a foregone conclusion. He and GOP leaders are promoting doubt about the system, which arguably has its flaws, and of course Fox serves as a force multiplier to their narratives.”\n\n\nSome politicians, like Bernie Sanders, literally predicted (on October 23rd, 2020) the exact outcome of election night because it was already known that mail-in ballots might take a bit longer to count and they would likely dramatically favor Democrats. Sanders even predicted Trump trying to end the voting early.\nA leaked audio recording from October 31st, 2020, of Steve Bannon shows him speaking about Trump’s plan to call the election early.\n2012 Election\n\nOn November 6th, 2012, Donald Trump tweeted that people should “march on Washington” to protest the election results. A few minutes later, he claimed that America “is not a democracy.”\n\n2016 Election\n\nIn February 2016, Donald Trump claimed that Ted Cruz’s campaign rigged the Iowa Caucus.\nOn April 16th, 2016, Donald Trump tweeted that the Republican primaries were rigged and boss controlled. On that appearance that he references, he goes on to speak about how delegates are just bribed and paid off to vote for certain candidates.\nOn August 1st, 2016, Donald Trump claimed the last election in 2012 was rigged, and claims with certainty that the 2016 election on November 8th is going to be rigged, and that Republicans “better be careful.”\nIn October 2016, Donald Trump claimed they were trying to rig the election at the polling booths, saying dead people were voting, illegal immigrants were voting, and that they were fighting in a rigged election.\nOn November 27th, 2016, Donald Trump tweeted that he would have won the popular vote against Hillary “if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.”\n\nFrom May 11th, 2017 to January 3rd, 2018, Trump created the Presidential Advisory commission on Election Integrity, also known as the Voter Fraud Commission. It requested an unusually invasive amount of voter data from the states, but all 50 states refused to comply. After Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap filed a lawsuit against the Republican members of the Commission for not sharing documents or scheduling information, the commission was disbanded by Trump. The Commission was not able to find any evidence of voter fraud.\n2020 Election\n\nOn April 7th, 2020, Donald Trump claims that there is voter fraud in the form of people filling out multiple ballots and dumping ballots for Trump, after claiming mail-in voting was okay when he did it, but not when other people do it.\nOn May 20th, 2024, Donald Trump answered in a press briefing that “thousands and thousands” of mail-in ballots were fraudulently filled out.\nOn May 24th, 2020, Donald Trump tweeted that the United States “cannot have Mail in Ballots,” saying it would be the “greatest Rigged Election in history.”\nOn August 24th, 2020, Donald trump states that the only way they can lose the election is if it’s rigged and someone takes it from us.\nOn September 23rd, 2020, Donald Trump would not commit to a peaceful transfer of power, claiming that the mail-in ballots were fraudulent and out of control.\nOn September 29th, 2020, Donald Trump claimed that mail-in ballots being sent out pre-emptively were all fraudulently done by the Democrats, and that Americans were going to see a “fraud like you’ve never seen.” He also claims that “we won’t know for months” for the counting of the mail-in ballots.\n\nTrump fluidly switched between definitions when he claimed the election was “rigged,” meaning it could be officials rigging polls, ballot boxes being stuffed, ballots being not counted, boxes being tossed, vote totals being changed, etc…etc…\nIt’s important to note that while Donald Trump claims ahead of time that voter fraud would be rampant in 2020, he never actually gives a way to make mail-in ballots more secure, he simply advocates for the elimination of them altogether, repeatedly, because he knows they will favor Democratic voters.\nDonald Trump attempted to call the election early, on the night of, despite everyone across the nation knowing it would take some time to count the incoming mail-in ballots. He also falsely claimed he won many states by margins that were impossible to be overcome, despite it having been completely untrue, and continues to call the mail-in ballots fraudulent, claiming that he already won the election. On November 5th, the next morning, he went as far as to tweet “STOP THE COUNT!” so he wouldn’t lose his majority.\nDominion v. Fox News\nIn June of 2021, Dominion filed a complaint against Fox News, alleging that the company engaged in a widespread campaign of defamatory behavior towards Dominion in order to salvage its reputation among conservative media listeners. Dominion’s lawsuit accused Fox of lying on four separate claims:\n\nDominion committed election fraud by rigging the 2020 Presidential Election\nDominion’s software and algorithms manipulated vote counts in the 2020 Presidential Election\nDominion is owned by a company founded in Venezuela to rig elections for the dictator Hugo Chávez; and\nDominion paid kickbacks to government officials who used its machines in the 2020 Presidential Election.\n\nFactual Allegations\n\nDominion was established in 2002 by CEO John Poulos and procured its first contract with New York state in July 2009.\nAfter it became clear that Trump would lose into the election, on November 6th, Donald Trump began to complain that his lead had “mysteriously disappeared.”\nOn November 7th, Fox projected Trump had lost the election.\nOn November 8th, Fox invited Sidney Powell onto the Sunday Morning Futures show to discuss Dominion voting fraud.\n\nPowell declared that there was “a massive and coordinated effort to steal this election from We the People of the United States of America, to delegitimize and destroy votes for Donald Trump, to manufacture votes for Joe Biden.”\n\n\n…more to the complaint, I don’t have time to read through all of this right now, though.\n\nDominion’s motion for summary judgement contains many damming emails showing that Fox News was knowingly capitalizing on fraudulent election claims to win back their audience after election night\n\n\n                  \n                   Dominion v Fox Death Threat 1\n                  \n                \n\nRUN\nI don’t need to do that we are already watching you.\nCome clean and you will live.\nWhat is the penalty for TREASON?\nFUCK ANTIFA, FUCK ANTIFA, FUCK ANTIFA, FUCK ANTIFA, FUCK ANTIFA, FUCK ANTIFA.

PB have you and there is nowhere you can run.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                   Dominion v Fox Death Threat 2\n                  \n                \n\nYou’re all fucking dead, You’re all fucking dead.

Fuck you, fucking scumbags. We’re gonna blow your fucking building up. Piece of fucking shit.\n\n\nElection Night\nThe election occurred on November 3rd and went as everyone predicted, with Donald Trump initially having a large lead and then slowly losing it as mail-in ballots were counted as the night progressed.\nAt 11:20 PM, Fox News called Arizona for Joe Biden, sending Donald Trump and his team into a fury. Jason Miller tweeted out, admonishing Fox News for calling the election early. Jared Kushner was also in contact with Rupert Murdoch as the night went on. At 2:30 AM the following morning, Trump told supporters “this is a fraud on the American public.” Trump said he wanted to go to the Supreme Court to stop the counting of ballots, then declared himself the winner of the election. Pence went up on stage afterwards, contradicting Trump and saying that, while he was sure they’d won the election, he would wait until every vote was counted.\nLegal Challenges\nIn July of 2022, a collection of 8 different conservative judges, politicians and analysts published a report called “LOST, NOT STOLEN: The Conservative Case that Trump Lost and Biden Won the 2020 Presidential Election.”  In the report, they go through all 64 cases that the Trump campaign put forth to Judges, claiming that every case was without merit and affirming the results of the 2020 election.\n\n\n                  \n                  LOST, NOT STOLEN, page 4 \n                  \n                \n\nWe therefore have undertaken an examination of every claim of fraud and miscount put forward by former President Trump and his advocates, and now put the results of those investigations before the American people, and especially before fellow conservatives who may be uncertain about what and whom to believe. Our conclusion is unequivocal: Joe Biden was the choice of a majority of the Electors, who themselves were the choice of the majority of voters in their states.\n\n\nThe Trump Campaign’s Court Cases\nQuoting from LOST, NOT STOLEN:\n“Of the 64 cases brought by Trump and his supporters, twenty were dismissed before a hearing on the merits, fourteen were voluntarily dismissed by Trump and his supporters before a hearing on the merits, and 30 cases included a hearing on the merits. Only in one Pennsylvania case involving far too few votes to overturn the results did Trump and his supporters prevail.”\nOther Court Cases\n2000 Mules\nOn May 20th, 2022, well known far right conspiracy theorist Dinesh D’Souza published a film called “2000 Mules,” where they alleged, with no solid evidence, that Democrats had organized a sophisticated system of ballot harvesting across several states.\nIn October of 2022, Atlanta citizen Mark Andrews filed lawsuits for defamation, conspiracy and intrusion on seclusion. A state investigation found that he had not committed any of the crimes alleged about him in the film, and on May 31st, 2024, Salem Media Group settled with Andrews, releasing a public apology and taking down the film and book.\nTrump’s Calls States to Change Votes\nDonald Trump’s January 2nd, 2021 Call to Brad Raffensperger\n(Trump made a phone call to the Election Investigator Frances Watson on December 23, 2020, repeating a lot of the false claims he’ll go on to repeat to Raffensperger later on.)\nOn January 2nd, 2024, Donald Trump (joined by trade advisor Peter Navarro, Justice Department official John Lott, law professor John C. Eastman, and attorneys Rudy Giuliani, Cleta Mitchell, Alex Kaufman, Kurt Hilbert, and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows) called  Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (joined by Raffensperger’s chief of staff Jordan Fuchs and general counsel Ryan Germany) to discuss finding enough votes to win the election.\nTrump claimed, with no evidence, that:\n\nthere were hundreds of thousands of signature forgeries\nthat 50’s of thousands of people had already been voted for\n4,502 people voted who were not on the voter registration roll\n18,000 people voted with vacant addresses\n900 voters who used a PO Box number\nat least 18,000 voters counted multiple times by Ruby Freeman\nthe water main breaking disrupted the vote process for malfeasance\nthat boxes of faked votes were brought in to be counted\nmore and more dumb claims with absolutely zero evidence cited.\n\nTrump continued to make accusations during the call, dismissing claims that he was simply getting these accusations from social media by countering that they were actually coming from “Trump media.” He also accuses Raffensperger of being criminally liable for not finding enough votes for Trump because they must have known about the voter fraud, and says that it would be a “big risk” for both of them if they weren’t able to flip the election in favor of Trump.\nTrump says to Raffensperger: “I think it’s very dangerous for you to say that [there’s no criminality].” and alludes to him engaging in criminal behavior many times during the call.\nMultiple times on the call Donald Trump implies that he will refuse to help in the future elections if Raffensperger won’t acquiesce to his demands for 11,000 votes. “I need 11,000 votes give me a break.”\nTrump’s campaign launched lawsuits against the state to contest the results, but ended up voluntarily dismissing it the day before court.\nTrump Pushing Knowingly False Claims\nPropagating Knowingly False Claims\nAll of these are taken from the January 6th report, starting on page 48:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeing Informed of the False ClaimContinuing to Spread the False ClaimThen-Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen (12/15/20): “And so he said, ‘Well, what about this? I saw it on the videotape, somebody delivering a suitcase of ballots.’ And we said, ‘It wasn’t a suitcase. It was a bin. That’s what they use when they’re counting ballots. It’s benign.’”President Trump one week later (12/22/20): “There is even security camera footage from Georgia that shows officials telling poll watchers to leave the room before pulling suitcases of ballots out from under the tables and continuing to count for hours.”Acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue (12/27 &amp; 12/31/20):“I told the President myself that several times, in several conversations, that these allegations about ballots being smuggled in in a suitcase and run through the machine several times, it was not true, that we looked at it, we looked at the video, we interviewed the witnesses, that it was not true … . I believe it was in the phone call on December 27th. It was also in a meeting in the Oval Office on December 31st.”President Trump later that week (1/2/21):“[S]he stuffed the machine. She stuffed the ballot. Each ballot went three times, they were showing: Here’s ballot number one. Here it is a second time, third time, next ballot.”GA Sec. State Brad Raffensperger (1/2/21):“You’re talking about the State Farm video. And I think it’s extremely unfortunate that Rudy Giuliani or his people, they sliced and diced that video and took it out of context.” … “[W]e did an audit of that and we proved conclusively that they were not scanned three times… . Yes, Mr. President, we’ll send you the link from WSB.” [Trump]: “I don’t care about a link. I don’t need it.”President Trump one day later (1/3/21):“I spoke to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger yesterday about Fulton County and voter fraud in Georgia. He was unwilling, or unable, to answer questions such as the ‘ballots under table’ scam, ballot destruction, out of state ‘voters’, dead voters, and more. He has no clue!”Attorney General Barr (12/1/20):“Then he raised the ‘big vote dump,’ as he called it, in Detroit. And, you know, he said, people saw boxes coming into the counting station at all hours of the morning and so forth…. I said, ‘Mr. President, there are 630 precincts in Detroit, and unlike elsewhere in the State, they centralize the counting process, so they’re not counted in each precinct, they’re moved to counting stations, and so the normal process would involve boxes coming in at all different hours.’ And I said, ‘Did anyone point out to you—did all the people complaining about it point out to you, you actually did better in Detroit than you did last time? I mean, there’s no indication of fraud in Detroit.’”President Trump one day later (12/2/20): “I’ll tell you what’s wrong, voter fraud. Here’s an example. This is Michigan. At 6:31 in the morning, a vote dump of 149,772 votes came in unexpectedly. We were winning by a lot. That batch was received in horror… . In Detroit everybody saw the tremendous conflict … there were more votes than there were voters.”Acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue (12/27/20):“The President then continued, there are ‘more votes than voters…’. But I was aware of that allegation, and I said, you know, that was just a matter of them ‘comparing the 2020 votes cast to 2016 registration numbers.’ That is ‘not a valid complaint.’”President Trump ten days later (1/6/21):“More votes than they had voters. And many other States also.”Acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue (1/3/21):“[W]e would say to him, you know, ‘We checked that out, and there’s nothing to it… . And we would cite to certain allegations. And so—like such as Pennsylvania, right. ‘No, there were not 250,000 more votes reported than were actually cast. That’s not true.’ So we would say things like that.”President Trump three days later (1/6/21): “In Pennsylvania, you had 205,000 more votes than you had voters. And the number is actually much greater than that now. That was as of a week ago. And this is a mathematical impossibility unless you want to say it’s a total fraud.”GA Sec. State Brad Raffensperger (1/2/21):[Trump]: “[I]t’s 4,502 who voted, but they weren’t on the voter registration roll, which they had to be. You had 18,325 vacant address voters. The address was vacant, and they’re not allowed to be counted. That’s 18,325.”… [Raffensperger]: “Well, Mr. President, the challenge that you have is the data you have is wrong.”President Trump two days later (1/4/21): “4,502 illegal ballots were cast by individuals who do not appear on the state’s voter rolls. Well, that’s sort of strange. 18,325 illegal ballots were cast by individuals who registered to vote using an address listed as vacant according to the postal service.”GA Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger (1/2/21): [Trump]: “So dead people voted, and I think the number is close to 5,000 people. And they went to obituaries. They went to all sorts of methods to come up with an accurate number, and a minimum is close to about 5,000 voters.” … [Raffensperger]: “The actual number were two. Two. Two people that were dead that voted. So that’s wrong.”President Trump four days later (1/6/21): “[T]he number of fraudulent ballots that we’ve identified across the state is staggering. Over 10,300 ballots in Georgia were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match Georgia residents who died in 2020 and prior to the election.”GA Sec. State General Counsel Ryan Germany (1/2/21): [Trump]: “You had out-of-state voters. They voted in Georgia, but they were from out of state, of 4,925.” … [Germany]: “Every one we’ve been through are people that lived in Georgia, moved to a different state, but then moved back to Georgia legitimately.”… “They moved back in years ago. This was not like something just before the election. So there’s something about that data that, it’s just not accurate.”President Trump four days later (1/6/21): “And at least 15,000 ballots were cast by individuals who moved out of the state prior to November 3rd election. They say they moved right back.”White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany (n.d.): “[T]he one specific I remember referencing was I don’t agree with the Dominion track.” … “I specifically referenced waving him off of the Dominion theory earlier in my testimony.”… [Q] “Are you saying you think he still continued to tweet that after you waved him off of it?” [A] “Yeah …”President Trump: Between mid-November and January 5, 2021, President Trump tweeted or retweeted conspiracy theories about Dominion nearly three dozen times.Trump Campaign Senior Advisor Jason Miller:“…the international allegations for Dominion were not valid.” [Q] “Okay. Did anybody communicate that to the President?” [A]: “I know that that was—I know that was communicated. I know I communicated it”President Trump:“You have Dominion, which is very, very suspect to start off with. Nobody knows the ownership. People say the votes are counted in foreign countries and much worse…”Attorney General Barr (11/23/20):“I specifically raised the Dominion voting machines, which I found to be one of the most disturbing allegations— ‘disturbing’ in the sense that I saw absolutely zero basis for the allegations … I told him that it was crazy stuff and they were wasting their time on that and it was doing great, great disservice to the country.”President Trump three days later (11/26/20):“[T]hose machines are fixed, they’re rigged. You can press Trump and the vote goes to Biden… . All you have to do is play with a chip, and they played with a chip, especially in Wayne County and Detroit.”Attorney General Barr (12/1/20): “I explained, I said, look, if you have a machine and it counts 500 votes for Biden and 500 votes for Trump, and then you go back later and you have a—you will have the 1,000 pieces of paper put through that machine, and you can see if there’s any discrepancy … there has been no discrepancy.”President Trump one day later (12/2/20): “In one Michigan County, as an example, that used Dominion systems, they found that nearly 6,000 votes had been wrongly switched from Trump to Biden, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. This is what we caught. How many didn’t we catch?”Attorney General Barr (12/14/20): “‘I will, Mr. President. But there are a couple of things,’ I responded. ‘My understanding is that our experts have looked at the Antrim situation and are sure it was a human error that did not occur anywhere else. And, in any event, Antrim is doing a hand recount of the paper ballots, so we should know in a couple of days whether there is any real problem with the machines.’”President Trump one day later (12/15/20): “This is BIG NEWS. Dominion Voting Machines are a disaster all over the Country. Changed the results of a landslide election. Can’t let this happen… .”Then-Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen (12/15/20): “[O]ther people were telling him there was fraud, you know, corruption in the election. The voting machines were no good. And we were telling him that is inconsistent, by ‘we,’ I mean Richard Donoghue and myself, that that was not what we were seeing.” … “There was this open issue as to the Michigan report. And—I think it was Mr. Cuccinelli, not certain, but had indicated that there was a hand recount. And I think he said, ‘That’s the gold standard.’”President Trump one day later (12/16/20):“‘Study: Dominion Machines shifted 2-3% of Trump Votes to Biden. Far more votes than needed to sway election.’ Florida, Ohio, Texas and many other states were won by even greater margins than projected. Did just as well with Swing States, but bad things happened. @OANN”National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien (12/18/20): “I got a call from, I think, Molly Michael in outer oval, the President’s assistant, and she said, ‘I’m connecting you to the Oval’ … somebody asked me, was there—did I have any evidence of election fraud in the voting machines or foreign interference in our voting machines. And I said, no, we’ve looked into that and there’s no evidence of it.”President Trump one day later (12/19/20): “… There could also have been a hit on our ridiculous voting machines during the election, which is now obvious that I won big, making it an even more corrupted embarrassment for the USA. @DNI-_Ratcliffe @SecPompeo”Acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue (12/31/20):“We definitely talked about Antrim County again. That was sort of done at that point, because the hand recount had been done and all of that. But we cited back to that to say, you know, this is an example of what people are telling you and what’s being filed in some of these court filings that are just not supported by the evidence.”President Trump two days later (1/2/21): “Well, Brad. Not that there’s not an issue, because we have a big issue with Dominion in other states and perhaps in yours… . in other states, we think we found tremendous corruption with Dominion machines, but we’ll have to see.” … “I won’t give Dominion a pass because we found too many bad things.”GA Sec. State Brad Raffensperger (1/2/21): “I don’t believe that you’re really questioning the Dominion machines. Because we did a hand re-tally, a 100 percent re-tally of all the ballots, and compared them to what the machines said and came up with virtually the same result. Then we did the recount, and we got virtually the same result.”President Trump four days later (1/6/21): “In addition, there is the highly troubling matter of Dominion Voting Systems. In one Michigan county alone, 6,000 votes were switched from Trump to Biden and the same systems are used in the majority of states in our country.” … “There is clear evidence that tens of thousands of votes were switched from President Trump to former Vice President Biden in several counties in Georgia.”\n\nA District Court declared that Trump and Eastman knowingly filed bogus court cases in order to further fight over the certification of the election and to obstruct the January 6th Committee from obtaining evidence of any conspiracy.\n\n\n\n                  \n                  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA SOUTHERN DIVISION, Case No. 8:22-cv-00099-DOC-DFM, filed October 19th, 2022\n                  \n                \n\nThere are four documents, however, in which Dr. Eastman and other attorneys suggest that—irrespective of the merits—the primary goal of filing is to delay or otherwise disrupt the January 6 vote. In one email, for example, President Trump’s attorneys state that “[m]erely having this case pending in the Supreme Court, not ruled on, might be enough to delay consideration of Georgia.” This email, read in context with other documents in this review, make clear that President Trump filed certain lawsuits not to obtain legal relief, but to disrupt or delay the January 6 congressional proceedings through the courts. The Court finds that these four documents are sufficiently related to and in furtherance of the obstruction crime. Accordingly, the crime-fraud exception applies, and the Court ORDERS Dr. Eastman to disclose the four documents…\nOn December 4, 2020, President Trump and his attorneys alleged in a Georgia state court action that Fulton County improperly counted a number of votes including 10,315 deceased people, 2,560 felons, and 2,423 unregistered voters.69 President Trump and his attorneys then decided to contest the state court proceeding in federal court, and discussed incorporating by reference the voter fraud numbers alleged in the state petition. On December 30, 2020, Dr. Eastman relayed “concerns” from President Trump’s team “about including specific numbers in the paragraph dealing with felons, deceased, moved, etc.” The attorneys continued to discuss the President’s resistance to signing “when specific numbers were included.” As Dr. Eastman explained the next day:\n“Although the President signed a verification for [the state court filing] back on Dec. 1, he has since been made aware that some of the allegations (and evidence proffered by the experts) has been inaccurate. For him to sign a new verification with that knowledge (and incorporation by reference) would not be accurate.”\nPresident Trump and his attorneys ultimately filed the complaint with the same inaccurate numbers without rectifying, clarifying, or otherwise changing them. President Trump, moreover, signed a verification swearing under oath that the incorporated, inaccurate numbers “are true and correct” or “believed to be true and correct” to the best of his knowledge and belief.\nThe emails show that President Trump knew that the specific numbers of voter fraud were wrong but continued to tout those numbers, both in court and to the public. The Court finds that these emails are sufficiently related to and in furtherance of a conspiracy to defraud the United States.\n\n\nPeople Who Told Trump he Lost\n\nAll of these people were trusted by Trump to investigate claims of election fraud:\n\nBill Stepien, Trump’s National Field Director for his campaign, a lifelong Republican, who also worked on Giuliana’s presidential campaign in 2007-2008, told Trump he had lost on election night.\nChris Miller, Trump’s Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, attested that Matt Oczkowski, Trump’s campaign’s top data scientist, told him on election night that he was going to lose.\nWilliam Barr, Trump’s Attorney General of the Department of Justice, told Trump repeatedly that he’d investigated and found absolutely no signs of voter fraud.\nJeffry Rosen, Trump’s acting Attorney General of the Department of Justice, called or met with Trump almost every day to tell him there was no election fraud.\nRichard Donoghue, Trump’s acting deputy attorney general, told Trump the information he was getting was false.\nChris Stirewalt, former Fox New political editor, said that Trump had no chance of winning the election after the votes were counted.\nJason Miller, the Trump Campaign Senior Advisor, informed Trump several times that there wasn’t enough evidence of fraud to overturn the election.\n\n“When our research and campaign legal team can’t back up any of the claims made by our Elite Strike Force Legal Team, you can see why we’re 0-32 on our cases. I’ll obviously hustle to help on all fronts, but it’s tough to own any of this when it’s all just conspiracy shit beamed down from the mothership.”\n\n\nMike Pence, Trump’s Vice President, said there was never evidence of widespread fraud, and that he believed there was no good evidence of enough fraud to overturn the election.\nMatthew Morgan, the General Counsel of Trump’s campaign, claimed that the Trump staff, including him and Marc Short and Greg Jacob, didn’t believe there was sufficient evidence of voter fraud.\nBrad Raffensperger, the Republican Georgia Secretary of State, denied every single claim that Trump made about election Fraud.\nBrian Kemp, the Republican Governor of Georgia, denied that the election was stolen in Georgia.\nA group of prominent Republicans (4 Federal Judges, 2 former Senators, a lawyer and someone who worked on Capitol Hill for 20 years) published a conservative report, titled Lost, Not Stolen, which claimed\n\nThe report concludes “that Donald Trump and his supporters had their day in court and failed to produce substantive evidence to make their case.” President Trump and his legal allies “failed because of a lack of evidence and not because of erroneous rulings or unfair judges … . In many cases, after making extravagant claims of wrongdoing, Trump’s legal representatives showed up in court or state proceedings empty-handed, and then returned to their rallies and media campaigns to repeat the same unsupported claims.”\n\n\nEleven of the judges who ruled against Trump were Trump federal judiciary appointments.\n\nOne of those Trump nominees, Judge Stephanos Bibas of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, rejected an appeal by the Trump Campaign claiming that Pennsylvania officials “did not undertake any meaningful effort” to fight illegal absentee ballots and uneven treatment of voters across counties. Judge Bibas wrote in his decision that “calling an election unfair does not make it so. Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here.” Another Trump nominee, Judge Brett Ludwig of the Eastern District of Wisconsin, ruled against President Trump’s lawsuit alleging that the result was skewed by illegal procedures that governed drop boxes, ballot address information, and individuals who claimed“ indefinitely confined” status to vote from home. Judge Ludwig wrote in his decision, that “this Court has allowed plaintiff the chance to make his case and he has lost on the merits” because the procedures used “do not remotely rise to the level” of breaking Wisconsin’s election rules.\n\n\nIvanka and Kushner, Trump’s daughter and son-in-law, prepared to move right after the election, with Ivanka stating she believed Barr’s testimony.\nAlex Cannon, Trump’s campaign lawyer, said he told advisers that there was no election fraud.\nKellyanne Conway, Trump’s counselor, wrote in her published memoir that she had told Trump he lost.\n\n“The team had failed on November 3, and they failed again afterward. By not confronting the candidate with the grim reality of his situation, that the proof had not surfaced to support the claims, they denied him the evidence he sought and the respect he was due. Instead supplicant after sycophant after showman genuflected in front of the Resolute Desk and promised the president goods they could not deliver.”\n\n\nKen Block, a data mining firm hired by Donald Trump to find evidence of voter fraud, said they found very little evidence of voter fraud, and that it was equal on the Democratic and Republican side.\n\n\n\n”Black Box” Votes Hidden Under Table in Georgia\nRudy Giuliani tweeted a heavily cut up video propagated by OAN that claimed boxes of illegitimately filled ballot boxes were being counted after election officials told counters to go home. Election officials investigated and released additional video and explanations showing that these claims were fabricated. Giuliani would later admit to lying in court about this case, claiming it was his 1st amendment right to lie. He would lose that case to the tune $148,000,000, and then have a bankruptcy case dismissed that he filed to avoid paying this debt due to lying about his assets.\nFalse Elector Scheme\nKenneth Chesebro’s Initial Memos\nKenneth Chesebro was an attorney from Wisconsin who began working with the Trump campaign at the behest of Jim Troupis, another lawyer for Trump’s campaign, around November 9th, 2020. He was responsible for the creation of the first few memos outlining a potential scheme that Trump could utilize to challenge the certification of the electoral vote on January 6th.\nChesebro believed that if people gathered and falsely attested to being legitimate state electors and transmitted said votes on December 14th to Congress (and NARA) that it would keep Trump’s chances alive to win the election should a court rule in his favor from between December 14th, the date that the electors in all 50 states certified their votes for president, and January 6th, the date that Congress was scheduled to count the electorate slates.\nUltimately there were 7 different states whom were selected to send false slates of electorates out from, here are those states and the accompanying state laws that dictate how slates of electors are legally supposed to be chosen:\n\nArizona\n\nArizona law [states]((www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/://www.azleg.gov/ars/16/00212.htm):\n\nA. On the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, 1956, and quadrennially thereafter, there shall be elected a number of presidential electors equal to the number of United States senators and representatives in Congress from this state.\nB. After the secretary of state issues the statewide canvass containing the results of a presidential election, the presidential electors of this state shall cast their electoral college votes for the candidate for president and the candidate for vice president who jointly received the highest number of votes in this state as prescribed in the canvass.\n\n\nThe false Arizona slate of electors were not elected and did not cast their ballots in concordance with the popular vote reported by the state.\n\n\nGeorgia\n\nGeorgia laws states:\n\nThe presidential electors chosen pursuant to Code Section 21-2-10 shall assemble at the seat of government of this state at 12:00 Noon of the day which is, or may be, directed by the Congress of the United States and shall then and there perform the duties required of them by the Constitution and laws of the United States.\n\n\nThe false electors did not meat in the seat of government, and were not chosen by the state legislature.\n\n\nMichigan\n\nMichigan law states:\n\nThe electors of President and Vice President shall convene in the senate chamber at the capitol of this state at 2 p.m., eastern standard time, on the first Tuesday after the second Wednesday in December following the elector’s election. At any time before receiving the certificate of ascertainment of appointment of electors from the governor or within 48 hours thereafter, an elector may resign by submitting the elector’s written and verified resignation to the governor…\n\n\nThe false slates didn’t meet in the senate chambers in the capitol.\n\n\nNevada\n\nNevada law states:\n\nThe Secretary of State shall preside at the meeting of presidential electors held pursuant to 3 U.S.C. § 7. Except as otherwise provided in this section and NRS 298.075, the nominees for presidential elector whose candidates for President and Vice President receive the highest number of votes in this State at the general election are the presidential electors.\n\n\nThe Secretary of State was obviously not present when the Nevada false electors certified and transmitted their vote.\n\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPennsylvania law states:\n\nThe electors chosen, as aforesaid, shall assemble at the seat of government of this Commonwealth, at 12 o’clock noon of the day which is, or may be, directed by the Congress of the United States, and shall then and there perform the duties enjoined upon them by the Constitution and laws of the United States.\n\n\nThe false slates didn’t meet at the seat of government.\n\n\nWisconsin\n\nWisconsin law states:\n\nThe electors for president and vice president shall meet at the state capitol following the presidential election at 12:00 noon the first Monday after the 2nd Wednesday in December.\n\n\nThe false electors were not able to meet in the state capitol.\n\n\nNew Mexico\n\nNew Mexico law states:\n\nB. The presidential electors shall be nominated by the state convention according to the rules of that party on file with the secretary of state.\nC. Upon the nomination of presidential electors, the chair and secretary of the convention shall certify the names and addresses of the nominees not less than sixty-three days prior to the election to the secretary of state. The secretary of state shall record the nominees’ names in the secretary’s office as the presidential elector nominees of that party.\n\n\nThe false electors were not nominated by the state convention, nor did the chair or secretary of the convention certify the names and addresses of the nominees.\n\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                   January 6th Select Committee, page 378\n                  \n                \n\nOn December 14th, using instructions provided by Chesebro, the fake Trump electors gathered and participated in signing ceremonies in all seven States. In five of these States—Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, and Wisconsin—the certificates they signed used the language that falsely declared themselves to be “the duly elected and qualified Electors” from their State. This declaration was false because none of the signatories had been granted that official status by their State government in the form of a certificate of ascertainment.\nThe paperwork signed by the fake Trump electors in two other States contained partial caveats. In New Mexico, the document they signed made clear that they were participating “on the Understanding that it might later be determined that we are the duly elected and qualified Electors… .” In Pennsylvania, the document they signed indicated that they were participating “on the understanding that if, as a result of a final non-appealable Court Order or other proceeding prescribed by law, we are ultimately recognized as being the duly elected and qualified Electors… .”\n\n\nEven Chesebro admitted his plan was dicey at best in his December 9th Memo:\n“In conclusion, it appears that voting by an alternate slate of electors is unproblematic in Arizona and Wisconsin; slightly problematic in Michigan (requiring access to the senate chamber);  somewhat dicey in Georgia and Pennsylvania in the event that one or more electors don’t attend (require gubernatorial ratification of alternates); and very problematic in Nevada (given the role accorded to the Secretary of State).”\nOn December 13th, Chesebro lays out to Eastman how Pence could declare the ECA unconstitutional and disrupt the expected electoral vote count proceeding to allow Trump to win the election. He says that Pence should break from the stated procedures of the Electoral Count Act, claiming it to be unconstitutional (in violation of the 12th amendment). Once Pence has recused himself from his role in the senate, some other Republican leader will take over and act “confused” about how to read which slate of electors is legitimate.\n“He then opens the two envelopes from Arizona, and announces that he cannot and will not, at least as of that date, count any electoral votes from Arizona because there are two slates of votes, and it is clear that the Arizona courts did not give a full and fair opportunity for review of election irregularities, in violation of due process.”\nChesebro would then go on to outline ways in which the states contesting their electoral votes being counted could recertify new electoral slates in the future, either by “rerunning the election, or engaging in adequate judicial review, or having its legislature appoint electors.”\n\n\n                  \n                  Chesebro&#039;s December 13th Memo \n                  \n                \n\nIf the Court were to dodge, then we would have a situation similar to 1877, in which the parties would realize that if they remained at loggerheads, with the President of the Senate perhaps refusing to open the votes of the contested states as long as his authority to count the votes was being challenged, and Pelosi refusing to hold an election for president in the House, and with January 20 looming, political leaders would face a choice. Either Pelosi would become acting president on January 20 (after resigning as Speaker) or the Senate would reelect Pence as Vice President, who would then become acting president on Jan. 20.\nIn this situation, which would seem messy and unpalatable to many,with renewed attention on the election abuses, and with several states controlled by Republican legislators faced with perhaps not being counted in the Electoral College, it doesn’t seem fanciful to think that Trump and Pence would end up winning the vote after some legislatures appoint electors, or else that there might be a negotiated solution in which the Senate elects Pence Vice President, and Trump agrees to drop his bid to be elected in the House, so that Biden and Harris are defeated, even though Trump isn’t reelected.\nAny of the outcomes sketched above seems preferable to allowing the Electoral Count Act to operate by its terms, with Vice President Pence being forced to preside over a charade in which Biden and Harris are declared the winner of an election in which none of the serious abuses that occurred were ever examined with due deliberation.\n\n\nChesebro’s secret Twitter account was leaked in which he’d made multiple tweets detailing how Trump could win the election via Pence overturning the vote while the electoral votes were being counted.\nDonald Trump’s Direct Involvement\nOn December 6th, Mark Meadows forwarded the November 18th Memo from Chesebro to Trump Campaign Senior Advisor Jason Miller. Meadows and Miller began to work to gather the 79 needed Republican electors on the November ballot in the 7 states they planned to have transmit false elector votes to Congress.\nTrump Campaign Associate General Counsel Joshua Findlay told the January 6th Select Committee ““it was my understanding that the President made this decision” to pursue the electorate scheme by December 7th or 8th. Findlay claimed that the campaign’s general counsel, Matthew Morgan directed the campaign lawyers to “look into electors in these potential litigation States.”\nIn deposition testimony provided to the Jan 6th Committee, RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel said that on or around December 12th, Trump, along with Eastman, called her to stress the importance of gathering alternate slates of electors.\n\n\n                  \n                  RNC Chairwoman Ronna Romney, J6 Report deposition, page 9\n                  \n                \n\nSo to the best of my recollection, and again it’s a long time ago, he 8 introduced me to John Eastman, I was not familiar with him at the time. So I vaguely 9 remember him mentioning that he was a professor, and then essentially he turned the 10 call over to Mr. Eastman, who then proceeded to talk about the importance of the RNC 11 helping the campaign gather these contingent electors in case any of the legal challenges 12 that were ongoing changed the result of any of the States. And so, that would fulfill the 13 requirement for the electors meeting if it went to the Supreme Court.\n\n\nTestimony from Special Assistant to the President, Cassidy Hutchinson, also confirms that Trump knew of the legal dubiousness of this elector plot, especially after most of the lawsuit had failed by mid December and his legal staff on his campaign began to quit and distance themselves from the campaign:\n“Committee Staff: [T]o be clear, did you hear the White House Counsel’s Office say that this plan to have alternate electors meet and cast votes for Donald Trump in States that he had lost was not legally sound?\nHutchinson: Yes, sir.”\nMany Doubted Alternate Electors Legitimacy\nFrom the J6 Committee Report, page 378:\n“Even so, 14 of the original Republicans who had been listed as electoral college nominees on the November ballot bowed out when the fake Trump electors gathered in December. Former Michigan Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land declined to attend, which the State’s GOP chair, Laura Cox, told the Select Committee was because “I think she just said she was uncomfortable with the whole thing” and that she “has her own beliefs.” A senior advisor for the Pennsylvania GOP said that Chairman Tabas “did not serve as an elector because Joe Biden won the election and it was Biden’s electors that were certified.” Former U.S. Representative Tom Marino (R-PA) said he backed out because “I’m a constitutionalist,” and “as a former prosecutor, when the attorney general says that he’s not finding anything there, that’s good enough for me.” The other eleven dropouts included a Georgia State lawmaker, a former State party chair from New Mexico, two former State party chairs from Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania’s RNC national committeewoman.\nOther participants asserted that they would have had much greater concerns if the Trump team had been more forthcoming about how the fake electoral votes would be used. The Trump Campaign’s director of election day operations in Georgia told the Select Committee that “I absolutely would not have” wanted to participate in organizing the Trump team’s fake electors in Georgia “had I known that the three main lawyers for the campaign that I’d spoken to in the past and were leading up were not on board.” He said he felt “angry” because “no one really cared if—if people were potentially putting themselves in jeopardy” by doing this, and “we were just . . .useful idiots or rubes at that point.””\nThe “Coup” Memos from Eastman\nEastman sent out two memos, one on December 23rd, and another one “war gaming the alternatives” on January 3, detailing how to get Pence to contradict the Electoral Count Act and either choose to count the false electors or force the house delegation, where the Republicans held a majority, to cast a vote for president (ideally choosing to reseat Donald Trump).\nPressuring Mike Pence\nOn January 2nd, Pence went over the procedures of the certification of the election, as set out in the Electoral Count Act, with his counsel, Greg Jacob, Chief of Staff Marc Short, and the Trump Campaign’s General Counsel Matt Morgan. Marc gave a statement to CNN intending to clarify that the Vice President does not have the power to unilaterally change the election outcome, attempting to clarify as concisely as possible to the public as to the role of the Vice President on January 6th, and that only lawful objections to the election should be entertained.\nOn that same day, Steve Bannon’s show, “Bannon’s War Room,” went live with an episode featuring Rudy Giuliani, Trump Campaign Strategic Advisor Boris Epshteyn , and John Eastman. They repeated many of the same false claims, both about voter fraud existing across multiple states, and Eastman continued to falsely assert that Pence has the authority to contravene the Electoral Count Act and subvert the expected process on January 6th to certify the election. He also claims that Congress can make a decision on their own about which slates of electors to accept, hoping that the states will accept all of the Republican slates due to the false claims that were continuing to be pushed concerning voter fraud. Eastman said that the outcome of the election comes down to the “courage and spine” of Mike Pence.\nIn his January 3rd Memo, where Eastman goes over several ways for Trump to remain president, he makes it clear that the only way Trump can possibly steal the election is if Pence acts in a way contrary to the ECA.\nOn January 4th, Trump and Eastman hold a meeting with Pence to pressure him to throw out the election. During the meeting, Eastman acknowledges that there are several foundational problems with the plan: the plan violates the Electoral Count Act which calls for all vote certificates to be “acted upon,” with objections being “finally disposed of,” whereas Eastman wanted Pence to set these aside and not resolve them. Secondly, the plot called for an extended break, when the ECA only specified two very short breaks to verify the submitted votes. Third and finally, the alternate slates of electors were not legitimate, as they had received no certificates of ascertainments from any state governors and no state legislatures were willing to go along with their plot. Pence found the arguments unconvincing, and was steadfast in his adherence to his proper role for January 6th.\nOn the night of January 4th, Trump began to ramp up the public pressure against Pence, calling for him to “come through for us” in a Georgia rally.\n\n\n                  \n                  Donald Trump in a January 4th, 2021 Georgia Rally\n                  \n                \n\nI think a lot of you despise them as you know there’s nothing the radical Democrats will not do to get power that they so desperately crave. Even the outright stealing of elections, like they’re trying to do with us. We’re not going to let it happen over the pass, and I hope Mike Pence comes through for us, I have to tell you. I hope that our great vice president comes through for us. He’s a great guy. Of course, if he doesn’t come through, I won’t like him quite as much. No, Mike is a great guy. He’s a wonderful man and a smart man and a man that I like a lot, but he’s going to have a lot to say about it. One thing with him, you’re going to get straight shots. He’s going to call it straight.\n\n\nOn January 5th, another meeting was between Eastman and Greg Jacob and Marc Short. Jacob recorded Eastman’s request that the Vice President needed to unilaterally reject the electors. Trump made multiple tweets that morning, one claiming that two senators would join in his plot in the senate to “#stopthesteal”, and another claiming that “The Vice President has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors,” applying more pressure to Pence.\nAt Trump’s request, him and Pence had another meeting that same day. Although the J6 Committee was unable to inquire about the exact details of the meeting, Marc Short seems to suggest that it was concerning Trump requesting Pence once again toss the votes during the certification. That night, in response to a NYT article leaking the earlier conversation, Donald Trump put out a statement containing multiple lies, the principle one being that him and Pence were “in total agreement” about what Pence could do on January 6th.\n\n\n                  \n                  Mike Pence on Fox News, August 2nd, 2023\n                  \n                \n\n“I had no right to overturn the election, and despite the fact that President Trump is continued to insist that, over the last two and a half years, I want people to know that I stood strong on the Constitution that day, by God’s Grace, and I always will.”\n“All they asked you to do was just take a pause that day.”\n“I say that’s completely false, and it’s contrary to American history, to our Constitution, and to the laws of this country. I never considered it, Martha. Look, the first time when I heard the speculation that I, as the Vice President, had the authority to overturn the election by returning or rejecting votes, I frankly dismissed it out of hand. look, the founders of this country had just won a war of independence against a king. And I was confident as a student of American history that those founders would have never vested the Vice President or anyone else with unilateral authority to decide what electoral college votes to count and which not to count. I was clear on that throughout, I was clear with President Trump throughout all the way up to the morning of January 6th. But let’s be clear on this point, it wasn’t just that they asked for a pause, the president specifically asked me, and his gaggle of crackpot lawyers asked me, to literally reject votes, which would have resulted in the issue being turned over to the House of Representatives and literally chaos would have ensued. So, Martha, people can read the indictment and frankly I said before I had hoped that it not come to this point, I don’t know if the government can meet the standard, the burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt for criminal charges, but the American people deserve to know their president Trump and his advisors didn’t just ask me to pause, they asked me to reject votes, return votes, essentially to overturn the election. To keep faith with the oath that I made to the American people and the almighty God, I rejected that out of hand and I did my duty that day.”\n\n\nThe same night, Steven Bannon went live with another episode of the War Room, applying even greater pressure to Pence while claiming “all hell is going to break loose tomorrow. Just understand this: All hell is going to break loose tomorrow. It’s going to be quick … It’s the fog of war.” Bannon also discussed putting Sen. Grassley’s number on the screen, and suggested they encourage users at TheDonald.win to contact the Senator.\nPence ultimately carried out his Constitutional duty as Vice President and certified the vote for Biden on January 6th.\nPressuring Acting A.G. for False Election Claims\nBarr’s Final Days\nPresident Trump began making claims of voter fraud on the same night of the election before all of the ballots had even been counted. On November 9th, two days after Biden was declared the winner, Barr authorized widespread investigations by the DoJ and FBI into allegations of voter fraud. On November 23rd, Trump had a meeting with Barr, trying to figure out why the DoJ didn’t have any strong cases yet for voter fraud, with Barr explaining that all of the accusations that had been made were without merit. On November 29th, Trump falsely claimed on Fox News that the FBI and DoJ were “missing in action” and that he would “stay out of it” despite him interfering at multiple levels of federal and state government in investigations into voter fraud.\nOn December 1st, Barr invited an AP reporter for an interview about the ongoing DoJ and FBI investigations, stating that they’d found absolutely nothing credible up to that point. Trump fought with Barr over the following two weeks, desperately attempting to get him to substantiate any kind of voter fraud. Repeating the same false claims to Barr that he had been over the last month, nothing was ever substantiate, with Barr eventually turning in his resignation on December 14th.\n\n\n                  \n                  Bill Barr, January 6th Committee Deposition\n                  \n                \n\nAnd, in that context, I made clear I did not agree with the idea of saying the election was stolen and putting out this stuff which I told the President was bullshit. And, you know, I didn’t want to be part of it. And that’s one of the reasons that went into me deciding to leave when I did.\nI observed, I think it was on December 1st, that—you know, I believe you can’t live in a world where the incumbent administration stays in power based on its view, unsupported by specific evidence, that the election—that there was fraud in the election.\n\n\nClark Introduced to Donald Trump\nOn December 15th, Trump had a meeting with his new Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, Acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue, Pat Cipollone, Mark Meadows, Acting Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Ken Cuccinelli, and Acting General Counsel of the Department of Homeland Security Chad Mizelle. This meeting was largely focused on a report on Dominion machine fraud by the Allied Security Operations Group (ASOG), which Barr had had the DoJ investigate and found no evidence supporting.\nOn December 22nd, Representative Scott Perry introduced Donald Trump to Jeffery Clark Acting Head of the Civil Division and Head of the Environmental and Natural Resources Division at the Department of Justice. On December 24th, Trump mentioned Clark’s name to Rosen, which Rosen felt was strange because he had no idea why Trump would be communicating with Clark, and Clark communicating with Trump would be against DoJ policies.\nOn the 27th, President Trump had another phone call with Rosen and Donoghue in which he continued to make false claim after false claim, with Donoghue debunking each and every claim. The Georgia claims about Ruby, the Pennsylvania claims of the 205,000 supposed additional votes, the ASOG report, etc…etc…Eventually during this phone call, Rosen said to Trump that he needed to understand “understand that the DOJ can’t and won’t snap its fingers and change the outcome of the election. It doesn’t work that way.”\nTrump responded to Rosen, saying “I don’t expect you to do that, just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican Congressmen.” Donoghue explained in his deposition that this was “an exact quote from the President.”\n\n\n                  \n                  Richard Donoghue, Transcribed Interview of Richard Peter Donoghue, (Oct. 1, 2023)\n                  \n                \n\nQ: Okay. So, in the middle of this call where he’s ranting about election issues, he mentions the special counsel, he mentions the explosion in Tennessee, he mentions FBI — allegations that the FBI doesn’t like him, and he mentions Hunter Biden. All of that —\nA: Yes.\nQ: — just are part of the tangents that you referenced in terms of his manner of speaking?\nA: Correct.\nQ: And any response by you or Mr. Rosen to any of those specific —\nA: So, throughout this — the President, obviously, does the great majority of the talking. But, throughout this, both DAG Rosen and I are just trying to respond very specifically to what he’s saying and saying things like, “Okay, that’s fine, sir.” This thing about Pennsylvania having more votes than ballots actually cast, “We can look at that, we’ll figure that out.” You know, as far as some of this other stuff, we were saying, “We’re aware of it. We’ve looked at it. We’ve got it,” or, “There’s nothing there.” I can’t remember if we were at the point — I think we were at the point in Georgia to be able to say that we had looked at that and did not believe that to be the case.\nQ: Yeah. That’s the next section of your notes, where you say “Georgia legislature” — or he talks about the Georgia legislature. Can you pick up from there?\nA: Right. So it says, “Georgia legislature is on our side. They want to bring a case, but the Governor won’t let them,” meaning they want to file some sort of civil case. The Governor won’t let them. He then goes back to the statistics. He says, “Statistically impossible for me to lose. Bookies had me at 100 percent on election night. It dropped to 32 percent in 4 or 5 hours. That’s never happened before.” So now this is an example of DAG Rosen responding. And he said essentially, “We’ll look at whether we have more ballots in Pennsylvania than registered voters. Should be able to check that out quickly. But understand that the DOJ can’t and won’t snap its fingers and change the outcome of the election. It doesn’t work that way.”\nQ: So DAG Rosen directly says, “We cannot snap our fingers and change the outcome of the election. It doesn’t work that way.” Clear pushback to the President looking for some sort of Department of Justice finger snap to delay the results of the election.\nA: Yes, that’s what he said. And he was, to some extent, pushing back and -\nQ: - Yeah.\nA: — trying to make the President understand the Department’s role.\nQ: Yeah. So what does the President say in response to that pushback from Mr. Rosen?\nA: He says, “I don’t expect you to do that. Just say that the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican Congressmen.”\nQ: Tell me more about that. What you did you interpret that to mean?\nA: So I put it in quotes. It is an exact quote from the President. I took that to mean that he and his campaign, I suppose, were going to be pursuing a political effort on the Hill to challenge electoral college votes. And we knew that was the case already. There was already public reporting on this. So I think the President and some of his supporters were talking about challenging electoral college votes when they made it to the Senate. And so that didn’t surprise me, that he had this avenue that he intended to pursue with what he called the “Republican Congressmen.”\n\n\nTrump brought up that people had told him that “Jeff Clark is great,” and that he “should put him in,” laying the groundwork for the events to come.\nClark’s Letter\nOn December 28th, 2020, Clark had Ken Klukowski, a senior counsel under Clark in the DoJ’s Civil Division, draft a letter to the Georgia Governor and Legislature alleging the DoJ had “identified significant concerns\nthat may a have impacted the outcome of the election in multiple States, including the State of Georgia.”  Everything in the letter, however, was a lie; the DoJ had zero reason to suspect any voter fraud at this point in time, and every investigation thus far has been a dead end.\nClark emailed Rosen and Donoghue, asking for a promotion so his title would look more authoritative on the letter, as well as requesting both of them to sign the letter.\n\n\n                  \n                  Jeffrey Clark, in an email to Rosen and Donoghue, December 28th, 2020\n                  \n                \n\nAttached is a draft letter concerning the broader topic of election irregularities of any kind. The concept is to send it to the Governor, Speaker, and President pro temp of each relevant state to indicate that in light of time urgency and sworn evidence of election irregularities presented to courts and to legislative committees, the legislatures thereof should each assemble and make a decision about elector appointment in light of their deliberations. I set it up for signature by the three of us. I think we should get it out as soon as possible. Personally, I see no valid downsides to sending out the letter. I put it together quickly and would want to do a formal cite check before sending but I don’t think we should let unnecessary moss grow on this\n(As a small matter, I left open me signing as AAG Civil - after an order from Jeff as Acting AG designating me as actual AAG of Civil under the Ted Olson OLC opinion and thus freeing up the Acting AAG spot in ENRD for Jon Brightbill to assume. But that is a comparatively small matter. I wouldn’t want to hold up the letter for that. But I continue to think there is no downside with as few as 23 days left in the President’s term to give Jon and I that added boost in DOJ titles.)\n\n\nDonoghue responded, saying “there is no chance that I would sign this letter or anything remotely like this,” with Rosen agreeing in a follow-up email.\nOver the following days, Clark continues to speak with Trump, as well as Donoghue and Rosen, eventually making it clear that Trump wants appoint him to being the Acting Attorney General, replacing Rosen as Rosen was unwilling to cosign Trump’s fraud while Clark was willing to play ball.\nThe January 3rd Oval Office Meeting\nWith tensions building in the White House between Trump and his DoJ, events would finally culminate in a dramatic meeting in the Oval Office on January 3rd.\nRosen requested a meeting at 6:15 PM with Donald Trump thorugh Mark Meadows on the 3rd. Before the meeting, Rosen and Donoghue discussed the potential leadership change in the DoJ with Cipollone and Pat Philbin, who both opposed the change in leadership. Rosen and Donoghue had previously had a conference call where almost every Assistant Attorney General agreed they would resign if Rosen were removed from office and replaced with Clark.\nClark made an impassioned argument for why he should be made the new Attorney General, but every person present in the room confirmed to Trump that they would resign (along with hundreds of others in the DoJ) if Trump actually appointed him to the role.\nUltimately, Trump was too scared by the threat of mass resignations to push through with Clark’s appointment, despite Clark’s pleas otherwise.\nEvents\nThe January 6th Rally\nMotivation and Purpose of the Protest\nDonald Trump hyped his supporters up for a large protest on January 6th, the day that the electoral vote would be certified, weeks before the actual event itself. The purpose of the protest was clearly aimed at protesting the certification of the election, with the goal of halting (or at least delaying) the certification. Trump continued to deny the results of the election and accused the media and political establishment of fighting against him. He tweeted for weeks to apply pressure as well to news networks and lawmakers to back his coup attempt in Congress.\nIt was plainly obvious in the weeks leading up to the January 6th event that the primary purpose of the protest was to protest the outcome of the election and to apply pressure to leaders to change the electoral vote.\nDecember 19th, 2020\n\nTrump tweets out a 36-page report alleging election fraud that would “swing victory to Trump,” and tells people that there will be a “Big Protest in D.C.’ that “will be wild!”\nTrump tweets out that Russia and China may have been involved in hacking the voting machines during the election.\nTrump tweets out “the lie of the year is that Joe Biden won!”\n\nDecember 20th, 2020\n\nTrump tweets out “GREATEST ELECTION FRAUD IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY!!!”\nTrump retweeted a tweet about GA Senator David Perdue about “fighting for Donald Trump” to challenge the Electoral College on January 6th.\nTrump retweeted a tweet claiming Senator-elect Tuberville “will challenge Electoral College” on January 6th.\n\nDecember 21st, 2020\n\nTrump tweets out his disappointment in Brian Hagedorn, a Wisconsin State Supreme Court Justice, and expresses his anger at his ruling against him in a case despite Trump endorsing him in his election.\nTrump tweets out a call for Conservatives to “call on state legislators to appoint new electors.”\n\nDecember 22nd, 2020\n\nTrump tweets out another lie, “THE DEMOCRATS DUMPED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BALLOTS IN THE SWING STATES LATE IN THE EVENING. IT WAS A RIGGED ELECTION!!!”\nTrump tweets out attacking John Thune over his recent statements that the Senate shouldn’t try to overturn the election, and pressuring the Republicans in the Senate to follow through on January 6th with the plan to overturn the election.\nTrump tweets out a video from OAN of Newt Gingrich saying he won’t accept Joe Biden as president, exclaiming “Newt Gingrich gets it, we are going to WIN!”\nTrump tweets out a video he recorded where he repeats many fraudulent election claims, claiming he “won big.”\n\nDecember 23rd, 2020\n\nTrump uploads a video describing how China is secretly controlling movies, the media and the Democratic party. The video also alleges that the only trustworthy media is OAN, Newsmax and the Epoch Times, far right, alternative media news outlets that had all uniformly helped Trump push false claims of voter fraud.\nTrump retweeted a tweet with an attached image called “Operation “PENCE” Card”, which contained false information about how Pence could reject “fraudulent” electors.\n\nDecember 24th, 2020\n\nTrump tweets out and reminds 8 Senators that he helped them win their elections, encouraging them to “fight” over the stolen election.\nTrump tweets out “VOTER FRAUD IS NOT A CONSPIRACY THEORY, IT IS A FACT!!!”\n\nDecember 26th, 2020\n\nTrump retweets a video from Ali Alexander with Congressman Andy Biggs as he talks about fighting on January 6th with the hashtags “DoNotCertify” and “JAN6.”\nTrump tweets out that the “2020 Presidential Election Voter Fraud [was] the biggest SCAM in our nation’s history,” saying he’ll “see everyone in D.C. on January 6th.”\nTrump retweets Greg Kelly who claims “A COUP was waged against” Donald Trump, and then implores several senators to “STEP FORWARD at the MOMENT OF TRUTH.”\nTrump tweets out that it’s “Time for Republican Senators to steo up and fight for the Presidency.”\n\nDecember 27th, 2020\n\nTrump tweets out that he’ll “see you in Washington, DC, on January 6th.”\n\nDecember 29th, 2020\n\nTrump tweets out to remind Republicans in Congress once again that he helped many of them win their elections.\n\nDecember 30th, 2020\n\nTrump tweets out “JANUARY SIXTH, SEE YOU IN DC!”\nTrump tweets out an article by Mark Levin about Congress contesting the election results on January 6th.\n\nDecember 31st, 2020\n\nTrump tweets out two different OAN videos, making more false claims about election fraud, with one explicitly referencing the electorate plot to overthrow the election, including the plan to steal the election in the House.\n\nJanuary 1st, 2021\n\nTrump retweets an account exclaiming “The calvary is coming” on “JANUARY 6TH”, with the hashtags “MarchForTrump” and “StopTheSteal” with the slogan “Be there, will be wild”\nTrump tweets out that a “BIG Protest Rally” in D.C. will take place on January 6th with the attached slogan “StopTheSteal!”\nTrump tweets out a thank you to Madison Cawthorn, a Representative who claims he will object to the 2020 election results.\nTrump retweets the same OAN video falsely claiming that multiple slates of electors are available to choose from on January 6th and that Republicans should steal the election in the House.\n\nJanuary 2nd, 2021\n\nTrump tweets out more threatening messages against politicians who oppose him, focusing once more on Georgia.\nTrump tweets out his thanks for the 11 senators (Cruz, Johnson, Lankford, Daines, Kennedy, Blackburn, Braun, Lummis, Marshall, Hagerty, Tuberville and Hawley) who have agreed to help him oppose the election on January 6th.\nTrump tweets out that the election was “An attempt to steal a landslide win. Can’t let it happen!”\nTrump tweets out a video, saying “This could be the biggest event in Washington D.C. History” to encourage people to join the January 6th protest.\n\nJanuary 3rd, 2021\n\nTrump tweets a Fox News video where Judge Jeanine details how the Republicans could steal the election by rejecting the electoral vote. “With 3% of the population fighting against tyranny [under Washington]…to many January 6th is such a moment.”\nTrump retweets an account falsely claiming that Pence can delay the inauguration date.\nTrump retweets Congress Owens statement “If you only do what’s easy, you will seldom do what’s right.”\nTrump retweets an account, exclaiming “We The People Refuse To Concede To A Fraudulent Election!!“.\nTrump retweets another endorsement of the January 6th protest with the hashtags “SaveAmerica” “DoNotCertify” “MillionMagaMarch” and “StopTheSteal.”\nTrump retweets Mike Lindell, who is “honored to be invited to speak at the biggest event in DC history!” and who believes that Donald Trump “will be our President for the next 4 years!!!”\nTrump tweets out a Breitbart article of a call he made encouraging State Legislators to decertify their electors.\n\nJanuary 4th, 2021\n\nTrump tweets out “How can you certify an election when the numbers being certified are verifiably WRONG. You will see the real numbers tonight during my speech, but especially on JANUARY 6th.”\nTrump retweets a tweet for the January 6th march that uses the hashtags “MarchForTrump” “StopTheSteal” and “DoNotCertify”.\nTrump tweets out a quote from Senator Ron Johnson “We are not acting to thwart the Democratic process, we are acting to protect it.”\nTrump tweets out “The “Surrender Caucus” within the Republican Party will go down in infamy as weak and ineffective “guardians” of our Nation, who were willing to accept the certification of fraudulent presidential numbers!”\n\nJanuary 5th, 2021\n\nTrump tweets out “Pleased to announce that @KLoeffler &amp; @sendavidperdue have just joined our greatStopTheSteal group of Senators. They will fight the ridiculous Electoral College Certification of Biden. How do you certify numbers that have now proven to be wrong and, in many cases, fraudulent!&quot;&quot;\nTrump tweets out “The Vice President has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors.” This is not within the powers of the Vice President.\nTrump tweets out “I hope the Democrats, and even more importantly, the weak and ineffective RINO section of the Republican Party, are looking at the thousands of people pouring into D.C. They won’t stand for a landslide election victory to be stolen.”\n\nJanuary 6th, 2021\n\nTrump tweets out “If Vice President @Mike_Pence comes through for us, we will win the Presidency. Many States want to decertify the mistake they made in certifying incorrect &amp; even fraudulent numbers in a process  NOT approved by their State Legislatures (which it must be). Mike can send it back!&quot;&quot; None of this is true, Pence did not have the power to reject the vote.\nTrump tweets out “States want to correct their votes, which they now know were based on irregularities and fraud, plus corrupt process never received legislative approval.  All Mike Pence has to do is send them back to the States, AND WE WIN. Do it Mike, this is a time for extreme courage!” None of this is true, Pence did not have the power to reject the vote.\nTrump tweets out “THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, OUR COUNTRY, NEEDS THE PRESIDENCY MORE THAN EVER BEFORE - THE POWER OF THE VETO. STAY STRONG!”\n\nSpeech at the Ellipse\nTrump’s team chose the Ellipse for the location of the rally on January 6th. It was about a mile’s walk from there to the Capitol. It featured a variety of speakers, many of them continuing to make the same false assertions of voter fraud and rigged Dominion voting machines. Many of the speakers also reiterated the same pressure for lawmakers and Pence to overturn the electoral vote results.\nThe event was set to begin at 9 AM, with Trump finishing his speech at 12:16 PM. According to the SS-OIG report, about 28,000 people had entered the secured area of the rally, with many more staying outside.\nSpeakers Before Trump\n\nThe speaker line-up and a full recording of the rally:\n\nPaula White\n\nShe lead the group in prayer at the start of the rally.\n\n\nKylie Jane Kremer\n\nShe was listed as the person in charge of the rally, she worked for “Women for America First,” which was the organization that procured the permit for the rally.\n\n\nMo Brooks\n\nU.S. Representative from Alabama\nGave a speech to fire up the crowd to tell them to “start taking down names and kicking ass” while making constant comparisons to 1776 and the fight to establish early America. He also challenged Republicans in Congress to stand up and challenge the election certification.\nIt was later reported that he admitted to wearing body armor at this speech, saying he was tipped off by the FBI of potential risks beforehand.\n\n\nKatrina Pierson\n\nFormer National Campaign spokesperson and Trump media surrogate\nIn her speech she also applies more pressure to Republican lawmakers to flip the vote in Congress during the certification, saying “we are going to fight for our president” and that every politician who turns their back on Trump will “lose their seats” in 2022. She also reasserts the false voter fraud allegations.\n\n\nAmy Kremer\n\nWFAF founder/chair, teapartypatriots.org National Coordinator; co founder, Women for Trump\nShe was listed as the person in charge of the rally, she worked for “Women for America First,” which was the organization that procured the permit for the rally.\nShe spoke about how foreign influence was stealing the election for the American public, including Russia and Ukraine, and that Georgia was a corrupt state for refusing to investigate their voter fraud claims. She also alleged the same false Pennsylvania/Georgia and other voter fraud claims again to the crowd.\nShe fires up the crowd, telling them that the election was stolen from Trump and that they “are here to save the Republic.”\n\n\nVernon Jones\n\nState representative from Georgia\nHe encouraged the people to fight once more in the rally and to “take our country back.”\n\n\nTexas Attorney General Paxton and Senator Paxton\n\nThe Senator reminds the audience that they’re fighters in a short speech.\n\n\nEric Trump and his wife\n\nComes out to fire up the crowd, reinforcing that Trump called them on to “descend on DC” and that Biden clearly lost the election. His wife also comes on to say “we are in this fight to the bitter end, we are gonna take our country back.”\nTrump Jr. also applies more pressure to Congress, saying that lawmakers “need to stand up” while they march on the capitol.\n\n\nKimberly Guilfoyle\n\nTrump Jr.’s fiancée, former Fox News host/pundit and Trump campaign adviser; Gavin Newsom ex\n\n\nTrump Jr.\n\n“You can be a hero or you can be a zero,” “choose wisely” and “fight” were repeated by Trump Jr. at the event, again encouraging lawmakers to refuse to certify the election. He says if the lawmakers don’t fight, “we’re coming for you.”\nIt’s interesting to note that Trump Jr. opens the speech saying they’re not protesting like Democrats and burning down buildings, then a few minutes later says they need to act more like Democrats when they protest later.\n\n\nMadison Cawthorn\n\nU.S. Representative from North Carolina\nHe claims that the lawmakers in Congress at the Capitol are weak, and reminds the audience that he plans to contest the election at 12 noon.\nHe also mentions “state legislatures” and the “constitution”, alluding to the idea that the legislatures should choose (or should have chosen) a different elector slate.\n\n\nRudy Giuliani and John Eastman\n\nGiuliani begins by outlining that “the plan for today is perfectly legal.” He says that the “vice president can cast [the election] aside” and “decide on the validity of these crooked ballots or send it back to the legislators.” “Let’s have trial by combat!” “This election was stolen.” “We’re gonna fight to the very end to make sure that doesn’t happen.”\nEastman came on stage and asserted once more that Pence had the power to delay the certification of the vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nDonald Trump’s Speech\nDonald Trump spoke at the Ellipse for about an hour and ten minutes, starting at 11:57 AM. While he does, at one point in this speech, say “I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard,” he spends the rest of the speech repeating three essential points to set the agenda for the day:\n\nHe diligently recounts every single accusation of voter/election fraud, with almost every single claim at this point having been debunked or shot down by his own administration.\nHe reminds his supporters that they are close to losing their country due to an illegitimate election.\nHe calls out several times that Mike Pence is the only person who can save the Republicans.\nHe constantly reminds those in Congress whom he helped run for election that they would lose their elections in the 2022 midterms.\n\n\nNotable quotes from his speech (transcript):\n\n“We took them by surprise and this year they rigged an election. They rigged it like they’ve never rigged an election before.”\n“All of us here today do not want to see our election victory stolen by emboldened radical-left Democrats, which is what they’re doing. And stolen by the fake news media. That’s what they’ve done and what they’re doing. We will never give up, we will never concede. It doesn’t happen. You don’t concede when there’s theft involved.”\n“And to use a favorite term that all of you people really came up with: We will stop the steal. Today I will lay out just some of the evidence proving that we won this election and we won it by a landslide. This was not a close election.”\n“We didn’t lose.”\n“We will not let them silence your voices. We’re not going to let it happen, I’m not going to let it happen.”\n(Audience chants: “Fight for Trump.“) “Thank you.”\n“And Rudy, you did a great job. He’s got guts. You know what? He’s got guts, unlike a lot of people in the Republican Party. He’s got guts. He fights, he fights.”\n“And he looked at Mike Pence, and I hope Mike is going to do the right thing. I hope so. I hope so. Because if Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election. All he has to do, all this is, this is from the number one, or certainly one of the top, Constitutional lawyers in our country. He has the absolute right to do it. We’re supposed to protect our country, support our country, support our Constitution, and protect our constitution.”\n“States want to revote. The states got defrauded. They were given false information. They voted on it. Now they want to recertify. They want it back. All Vice President Pence has to do is send it back to the states to recertify and we become president and you are the happiest people.”\n“And I actually, I just spoke to Mike. I said: “Mike, that doesn’t take courage. What takes courage is to do nothing. That takes courage.” And then we’re stuck with a president who lost the election by a lot and we have to live with that for four more years. We’re just not going to let that happen.”\n“We’re gathered together in the heart of our nation’s capital for one very, very basic and simple reason: To save our democracy.”\n“For years, Democrats have gotten away with election fraud and weak Republicans. And that’s what they are. There’s so many weak Republicans. And we have great ones. Jim Jordan and some of these guys, they’re out there fighting. The House guys are fighting. But it’s, it’s incredible. Many of the Republicans, I helped them get in, I helped them get elected. I helped Mitch get elected. I helped.\n“And you have to get your people to fight. And if they don’t fight, we have to primary the hell out of the ones that don’t fight. You primary them. We’re going to. We’re going to let you know who they are. I can already tell you, frankly.”\n“But this year, using the pretext of the China virus and the scam of mail-in ballots, Democrats attempted the most brazen and outrageous election theft and there’s never been anything like this. So pure theft in American history. Everybody knows it.”\n“But we look at the facts and our election was so corrupt that in the history of this country we’ve never seen anything like it. You can go all the way back.”\n“Republicans are, Republicans are constantly fighting like a boxer with his hands tied behind his back. It’s like a boxer. And we want to be so nice. We want to be so respectful of everybody, including bad people. And we’re going to have to fight much harder.”\n“And Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us, and if he doesn’t, that will be a, a sad day for our country because you’re sworn to uphold our Constitution.”\n“Now, it is up to Congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy. And after this, we’re going to walk down, and I’ll be there with you, we’re going to walk down, we’re going to walk down. Anyone you want, but I think right here, we’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them.”\n“Because you’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong. We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated, lawfully slated.”\n“But we’ve done it quickly and we were going to sit home and watch a big victory and everybody had us down for a victory. It was going to be great and now we’re out here fighting.”\n“Today we see a very important event though. Because right over there, right there, we see the event going to take place. And I’m going to be watching. Because history is going to be made. We’re going to see whether or not we have great and courageous leaders, or whether or not we have leaders that should be ashamed of themselves throughout history, throughout eternity they’ll be ashamed.”\n“We will not be intimidated into accepting the hoaxes and the lies that we’ve been forced to believe. Over the past several weeks, we’ve amassed overwhelming evidence about a fake election.”\n“By the way, Pennsylvania has now seen all of this. They didn’t know because it was so quick. They had a vote. They voted. But now they see all this stuff, it’s all come to light. Doesn’t happen that fast. And they want to recertify their votes. They want to recertify. But the only way that can happen is if Mike Pence agrees to send it back. Mike Pence has to agree to send it back.” (Audience chants: “Send it back.“)\n“You will have an illegitimate president. That’s what you’ll have. And we can’t let that happen.”\n“The radical left knows exactly what they’re doing. They’re ruthless and it’s time that somebody did something about it. And Mike Pence, I hope you’re going to stand up for the good of our Constitution and for the good of our country. And if you’re not, I’m going to be very disappointed in you. I will tell you right now. I’m not hearing good stories.”\n“So when you hear, when you hear, while there is no evidence to prove any wrongdoing, this is the most fraudulent thing anybody has, this is a criminal enterprise. This is a criminal enterprise.”\n“The Republicans have to get tougher. You’re not going to have a Republican Party if you don’t get tougher. They want to play so straight. They want to play so, sir, yes, the United States. The Constitution doesn’t allow me to send them back to the States. Well, I say, yes it does, because the Constitution says you have to protect our country and you have to protect our Constitution, and you can’t vote on fraud. And fraud breaks up everything, doesn’t it? When you catch somebody in a fraud, you’re allowed to go by very different rules.”\n“So I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do. And I hope he doesn’t listen to the RINOs and the stupid people that he’s listening to.”\n“We won in a landslide. This was a landslide. They said it’s not American to challenge the election. This the most corrupt election in the history, maybe of the world.”\n“So today, in addition to challenging the certification of the election, I’m calling on Congress and the state legislatures to quickly pass sweeping election reforms, and you better do it before we have no country left.”\n“If we allow this group of people to illegally take over our country because it’s illegal when the votes are illegal when the way they got there is illegal when the states that vote are given false and fraudulent information.”\n“We have overwhelming pride in this great country and we have it deep in our souls. Together, we are determined to defend and preserve government of the people, by the people and for the people.”\n“But I said something’s wrong here, something is really wrong, can have happened. And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”\n“So we’re going to, we’re going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. I love Pennsylvania Avenue. And we’re going to the Capitol, and we’re going to try and give. The Democrats are hopeless — they never vote for anything. Not even one vote. But we’re going to try and give our Republicans, the weak ones because the strong ones don’t need any of our help. We’re going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country. So let’s walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.”\n\n\n\nRiot at the Capitol\nTimeline\n\n\nKey events\n\n6:00 AM - People begin to construct a gallows outside of the Capitol.\n6:29 AM - Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the Oath Keepers, reminded his group’s members that DC prohibited blades over “3 inches” and encouraged them to “[k]eep [the knives] low profile.”\n11:58 AM - The President begins his speech at the Ellipse.\n12:53 PM - The Proud Boys break through the outer perimeter and engage USCP officers.\n1:10 PM - Ali Alexander texts to Thomas Van Flein, Representative Gosar’s Chief of Staff, “I think you and your staff should maybe leave” “This is hell out here”\n1:11 PM - The President finishes his speech at the Ellipse event.\n2:13 PM - Proud Boys member Dominic Pezzola breaches the Capitol building with a stolen riot shield.\n2:15 PM - The rioters reached the second floor, where USCP officer Eugene Goodman lured insurrectionists away from the open Senate Chamber doors leading to the Vice President’s Office where Pence and his family were being held by the Secret Service.\n\nPence refused to leave the capitol because he didn’t want the world to see the US Vice President fleeing the Capitol, according to testimony from Mr. Jacob to the January 6th Committee.\n\n\n2:38 PM - “Stack One” of the Oath Keepers breaches the Rotunda Doors on the east steps of the Capitol.\n6:00 PM - The USCP declares the Capitol clear of protestors.\n8:05 PM - Mike Pence enters the Senate chambers to resume the count.\n\n\n\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General, The Secret Service’s Preparation for, and Response to, the Events of January 6th, 2021\n\n140 police officers were injured, $3m in damage, three USCP officers died following the attack.\nThe Secret Service observed at the Ellipse rally a number of individuals wearing body armor, communicating via radios, climbing trees, and avoiding entry through the magnetometers into the secure area.\nA pipe bomb was discovered by USCP officers on January 6th outside of the DNC, which Kamala passed by within 20 feet of about 2 hours earlier.\nAt the Ellipse security checkpoint, the Secret Service confiscated 269 knives/blades, 242 pepper sprays, and 94 “miscellaneous” items.\nThe Secret Service denied Trump’s request to go to the Capitol.\nThe Secret Service considered evacuating Pence from the Capitol, but he did not want to leave.\nAccording to the FBI, the pipe bomb found was “viable” and “could have detonated.”\nThe OIG reported several significant issues when it came to obtaining evidence from the Secret Service, including wiped phones, redacted documents, and refusal to turn over emails without being allowed to internally review first, all in violation of the law establishing the OIG.\nThe Secret Service Director, Kimberly Cheatle, responded to these accusations, claiming that it was actually the OIG that was delayed in responses and operating in such a way that was causing unnecessary delays or confusion for making available appropriate information to the OIG.\n\n\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch forcing their way in\n\n\nProud Boys\nTrump “stand back and stand by” comments\n\ndocs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R5eWiVJtVubbA122gu4XGshGmPlrTmRiiKbmoytBofs/edit#gid=2054751229\nwww.youtube.com/watch\nwww.oig.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/assets/2024-08/OIG-24-42-Aug24-Redacted.pdf\nEnrique indictment - www.justice.gov/usao-dc/press-release/file/1510791/dl\n\nMeeting between Stewart Rhodes and Enrique Tarrio | Speak about 1775, “fighting” | “counter-insurrection” - www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/11/29/rhodes-oathkeepers-sedition-verdict-jan6/\ninsurrection - extremism.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs5746/files/GoToMeeting%20Transcript.pdf\nOath Keepers\nTraining video featuring Roger Stone and Oath Keepers people\n\n(IG post)\nAdvertisement for November 14th rally\nDecember 12th call to violently overturn the election\nJanuary 5th advertisement for Capitol “defense”\nThey focus recruitment on current and former military.\nIndictment for Stewart Rhodes III\n\nThe “Stack One” group, involving Kelly Meggs, Kenneth Harrelson, Jessica Watkins, Joseph Hackett, David Moerschel, and other members broke through the Rotunda Doors at 2:38 PM.\nThey tried to break into the Senate Chambers but were repelled by Capitol Police.

This is not Black Lives Matter folks, this is not Antifa, these are Patriots, and perhaps they’ve finally boiled over.”\n70:00 - “You see the air filled with the mist of mace, the stinging gas that the police will be implementing and that is also being implemented against the police as patriots - wow - receiving blows to the head from billy clubs…We expect this situation to become ever more dire.”\n120:38 - “The revolution will be televised.”\n120:50 - Elijah Shaffer Tweet: “BREAKING: I am inside Nancy Pelosi’s office with the thousands of revolutionaries who have stormed the building.

We haven’t had any fight in Congress, we haven’t had any fight in our legislatures, so this is what’s gonna happen. We the people are gonna have to fight, again, we didn’t come here as violent revolutionaries, but, the history is definitely being made right now. I don’t know if today is the turning point that will change the course of American history or if this is just the nexus of the beginning of we the people taking our country back.”\n1:44:40 - “At least one woman has been shot, she may be the first casualty of the second American Revolution.”\n1:48:36 - After reading Trump’s tweet requesting people remain peaceful: “The problem with that, Mister President, is that we have. We have for 4 years. We’ve been abused for 4 years. We’ve tried to remain peaceful, we’ve tried to remain law-abiding, for the last years our cities were burned around us as we were locked inside of our own homes, as criminals were given complete abandon as time after time Antifa and BLM protestors were arrested in violent acts and then released the next day to perform them again. Time and time again we’ve tried to be the party of Law and Order, we’ve tried to respect the status quo, the laws, the system as we wish to uphold it. Instead, we’ve been disappointed, we’ve been betrayed, we’ve been stabbed in the back literally many times. Now, perhaps, the patience has run out.”\nSeveral times during this hour of broadcast, a JFK quote is displayed on the screen which reads “Those who make peaceful revolution impossible, make violent revolution inevitable.”\n168:43 - “Trump encouraging his supporters to stay peaceful, which they absolute have.”\n174:29 - Owen Shroyer reporting - “It looks like there were agent provocateurs who actually started the breaching procedure, but because there were so many Trump supporters around it was just like a flood of momentum, “oh somebody’s comin’ in, oh the barrier went down, oh now we’re just all goin’ in” lead to at least one person getting shot and then just all hell breaking loose.”\n181:45 - “[Imagine if we were the Democrat media] and we could just sit here and go “well a small, peaceful gathering of Trump supporters occurred earlier today and no one was hurt, nothing really happened, it was just regular Americans expressing their right to protest, and if you dare to oppose this, and all of this talk of sending in the national guard is clear evidence of tyranny and the fascism that is slowly gripping our entire country, and if you don’t support this you are a racist and you want innocent people to be murdered by the police.” We don’t have the luxury of being able to ignore reality here, we have to face it as it comes.”\n189:55 - “People are now looking into the people who have broken in and some are seeing tattoos that look suspiciously like communists.”\n\n\nwww.tmz.com/2021/01/06/woman-maced-pepper-spray-storm-us-capitol-revolution/\n\n“We’re storming the capital, it’s a revolution.”\n\n\ncdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/9535687_hypatia-h_f9374b3c5ffb0befcffc75e67ad3b27a-h_46610fb14df722934570dfc0b656febc.jpg\nmedia.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210106174535-07-us-capitol-riots-0106.jpg,c_fill/f_webp\nx.com/misstessowen/status/1346932836704653314\nMICHAEL malice tweet - x.com/michaelmalice/status/1346915334687780870 “every politician should be huddled in their home in fear, just like they wanted the rest of the country to be for months”\nAli Alexander, official organizer of the “StopTheSteal” movement, tweets “First official day of the rebellion.”\n\nRewriting January 6th\n\ntucker VERSION - www.youtube.com/watch\nCNN VIDEO OF JUDGE VIDEO - www.youtube.com/watch\n\nJanuary 6th Convictions\n\nshroyer stuff - www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/infowars-host-owen-shroyer-gets-2-months-in-prison-in-capitol-insurrection-case\nwww.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/1eewbdm/the_14_j6ers_convicted_of_seditionist_conspiracy/\nwww.reddit.com/r/JamiePullDatUp/comments/1ambwrx/announcing_the_debunking_master_list/\n\nImportant Notes\nwww.documentcloud.org/documents/23731963-dominion_3-21-23_hearing_slides-used-at-hearing_redacted SYDNEY POWEL THROUGHLINE OF BULLSHIT P128 page 175\nwww.youtube.com/watch\nRupert Murdoch, January 20th, 2021.\nThe more I think about McConnell’s remarks or complaint the more I agree.\nTrump insisting on the election being stolen and convincing 251 of Americans was a huge\ndisservice to the country.

Due to a statement released the day before by the International Boxing Association, an organization that was suspended by the IOC in 2019, many people (see: conservative commentators) have accused Khelif of being either transgender or intersex.\nAs of August 2nd, there is no credible evidence whatsoever that Khelif is trans or intersex. The IBA has been an organization that has been plagued with scandals for many years, hence their eventual withdrawal from the IOC in 2023. It can be said that the IBA is likely influenced significantly by Russia, as the CEO since December 12th, 2020 is Umar Kremlev, who’s background is in Russian boxing, and because their primary sponsor is Gazprom, a Russian energy company. Khelif was also disqualified in 2023 after she defeated Russian boxer Azalia Amineva, before her finals match.\nKhelif has competed since she was 19 years old, she is from the country of Algeria and appears to have a life lived as a female according to her family. She has competed and lost to other cisgender women in the past. Nothing about her current or past performance seems to suggest that she is transgender or intersex.\nSources\n\nIBA, “IBA Board of Directors Meeting Minutes March 25th, 2023, 10:00 – New Delhi, India\n\nApril 29th, 2023; Accessed August 1st, 2024\n\n\nUnicef, “A top female boxer, Imane Khelif, dreams of gold to inspire young people”\n2.

Yerolimpos, the IBA’s CEO and secretary general at the time, said both women failed two different tests.\n\nNo specific information was given about what the lab tested for.\nThe IBA released a statement that the women didn’t undergo a testosterone examination, but “a separate and recognized test.”\n\n\nThe IOC released a statement claiming that the prior disqualifications were “arbitrary” and “taken without any proper procedure.”\nThree people familiar with the details of the women pointed out that their prior DQ came three days after Khelif defeated Russian Azalia Amineva.\nImportant Notes - Washington Post article’s tone seems to blame Russian propaganda and a rigged/corrupt IBA as the reason why people are now claiming that the two boxers are transgender. According to WaPo, it seems that no credible evidence exists at this point in time to conclude either boxer is transgender.\n\n\nFox News, “Who is Imane Khelif: The Algerian Olympic boxer deemed to have male chromosomes”\n\nKhelif debuted at 19 years old\n\nCame in 17th at the 2018 World Championships, sanctioned by IBA\n19th in the 2019 Women’s World Boxing Championships\n2nd place in 2022 in the Women’s World Boxing Championships\nWon gold medals in the 2022 African Championships, Mediterranean Games and 2023 Arab Games\n\n\nIn 2023, Khelif was disqualified in a gold medal fight over gender eligibility issues, with IBA President Umar Kremlev to Russia’s TASS Agency: “Based on DNA tests, we identified a number of athletes who tried to trick their colleagues into posing as women. According to the results of the tests, it was proved that they have XY chromosomes. Such athletes were excluded from competition.”\nThe Algerian Olympic Committee said that Khelif was DQ’d for high T levels, according to Reuters (according to Fox)\nThe IBA reiterated in a new statement before Kheli’s match on August 1st, claiming that Khelif and Lin were disqualified after testing, also stating: “This test conclusively indicated that both athletes did not meet the required necessary eligibility criteria and were found to have competitive advantages over other female competitors.”\nThe IBA says Khelif underwent two tests, one in 2022 and the other in 2023, but withdrew from the appeal process for the 2023 decision.\nImportant Notes - The Fox News article is relatively even and doesn’t heavily examine any of the backgrounds or motivations for anything being said and just lays out the facts as they are.\n\n\nIBA, “Statement made by the International Boxing Association regarding Athletes Disqualifications in World Boxing Championships 2023”\n\nThe IBA made a statement the day before the fight, claiming that, although they did not do a T level test, they did another test, who’s specifics are confidential, but they claim it accurately assessed that “both athletes did not meet the required necessary eligibility criteria and were found to have competitive advantages over other female competitors.”\nImportant Notes - Why is the IBA releasing this statement? Why are they so vague about what tests they did, or how they determined the two competitors to be ineligible? Is this standard practice when announcing these kinds of disqualifications?\n\n\nInternational Olympic Committee, “Joint Paris 2024 Boxing Unit/IOC Statement”\n\nThe IOC claims that the IBA’s disqualification of the two boxers was done in an arbitrary manner by the IBA, stating that, according to IBA minutes, “this decision was initially taken solely by the IBA Secretary General and CEO” and only ratified/verified afterwards.\nThe IOC claims that gender is only determined by looking at a competitor’s passport.\nImportant Notes - The IOC claims that there is good reason to believe that the IBA’s decision is arbitrary and that they lacked clear guidance on even how to test for gender, and also note the IBA’s suspension in 2019 and withdrawal of recognition in 2023.\n\n\nThe Guardian, “Angela Carini abandons Olympic fight after 46 seconds against Imane Khelif”\n\nThis contains the largest statements I could find from the fighter.\nImportant Notes - She never claims she “feared for her life” or anything like that, and doesn’t seem to offer an opinion on whether or not the fight was unfair in any way.\n\n\n\nWhat Happened?"},"About":{"title":"About","links":["Research/Library/Events/Clinton-Parameters","1723538695-IQTW"],"tags":[],"content":"Welcome!\nHi!

At cursory glance, it would seem obvious, almost self-evident that the former president has not been treated harshly by the institutions of this country.\nBut is “harsh” the same as “unfair”?\nShould Trump’s treatment be truly that shocking?\nIs it actually unfair, or is this just a convenient lie Trump supporters tell themselves to cope with a historically corrupt leader?\nI’ll be honest, not many things baffle me more than conservative’s confused indignation for Trump’s treatment in this country.\nDoes he have many enemies? Yes, of course, but didn’t come to Washington to make them? Was his explicit goal not to “drain the swamp”? Did he also not make an enemy out of former personal attorney’s, like Michael Cohen, former campaign staff and managers, like Brad Parscale and Bill Stepien, former government appointed officials, like his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, even his own Attorney General, William Barr, former political allies like Jeff Sessions, Mitch McConnell, and Paul Ryan, and countless others both in and outside of his administration that he alone deemed disloyal? Hell, Trump even attacked Fox News for calling the Arizona race on election night for daring to do their jobs.\nIs it really  surprising that a man who makes so many enemies would have so few friends?\nAside from turning allies to enemies, Trump’s also abused both his rhetoric as a candidate and his powers in office in ways that, while not always illegal, are certainly morally reprehensible.\nIs it any wonder that those in this country might have questioned Trump’s allegiance to this country when he was on TV calling for Russia to release 30,000 e-mails from Hillary Clinton’s servers? Does it give no pause that he did this while at the same time working with Roger Stone to coordinate media dumps from Wikileaks that were obtained from DNC servers by Russian hackers? Trump even pardoned Paul Manafort, a man so connected to Russia that a Republican lead Senate Intelligence Committee considered him a grave threat, and believed Russia was acquiring information about Trump’s campaign through him. And yes, in case you were wondering, this is same Paul Manafort who was charged with defrauding the US Government, witness tampering and obstruction of justice. And yes, the very same Paul Manafort whom Trump saw fit to reward his loyalty by pardoning him before leaving office.\nRegardless of the personal feelings we may have about Trump, and by we, I mean me, I’m not here to talk about the ethics, or lack thereof, of Donald Trump, nor my personal dislike - I think I had hatred written here initially - for the man. I’m here to argue the affirmative that he ought to be in prison.\nSo, Trump’s vicious violations of norms and his penchant for pardoning all of those close to him of felonious crimes aside, Trump’s disdain for the rule of law and his criminal conduct as president are worthy of legal condemnation. While many are willing to support Trump’s aggressive rhetoric on social media, I find that those who support him in his criminal cases only do so out of ignorance, deliberate or otherwise, of the facts of said cases.\nSo let’s review those facts.\nThe first matter is a simple one, the federal classified documents case in Mar-a-Lago.\nIn March of 2021, NARA, the National Archives and Records Administration, requested from Donald Trump he return boxes and boxes of potentially classified material that he had personally overseen removed from the White House and stored in his resort at Mar-a-Lago. Trump repeatedly refused these requests, and only returned 15 of these boxes almost a year later in January of 2022 after repeated badgering. These were not all of the boxes with classified materials that Trump had taken with him, only a few boxes that Trump had his employee, Walt Nauta, go through first to see what he felt like sending back. After NARA discovered classified material in said boxes on February 9th, of 2022, the case was referred to the DoJ, leading the FBI to open an investigation in March.\nDonald Trump stored this material, knowing it was classified, and knowing that Mar-a-Lago was not an approved storage facility for said information.  Some of information Trump retained were national defense secrets, in a club that was accessed by tens of thousands of members and guests in the duration of its storage. He did this despite repeated requests to return it, and once he realized federal agencies were looking for it, he instructed multiple employees and legal counsel to move around and hide the boxes in order to obscure what material he still possessed, all while lying to investigators about the classified material.\nHe also stands accused of showing off some of this classified material to reporters and journalists who would come by for interviews, with two cases being mentioned directly in the indictments. In one of these instances, there exists an audio-recording of Trump meeting with an interview team, none of whom possessed any security clearances. Trump braggadociously showed some of the documents off, describing a “plan of attack” that he claimed was prepared for him by the Department of Defense and a senior military official, most likely to exonerate him from claims of being a war hawk. Trump himself told the individuals that the plan was “highly confidential .. and “secret.” He also mentioned that ”as president he could have declassified it,’” and, “Now he can’t, you know, but this is still a secret.”\nUnder 18 USC 793(e), the willful retention of national defense information is a crime. Of this, Trump is guilty.\nUnder 18 USC 1512(k), the deliberate obstruction of any federal investigation is also crime. Trump’s orders to his employees to hide information from his own lawyers or federal investigators is a deliberate obstruction of said investigators’ investigation. Of this, Trump is also guilty.\nAnd what of the election fraud case?\n18 USC 371 speak of two or more people conspiring either to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States, and 18 U.S.C. 241 makes it unlawful for two or more people  to agree to injure, threaten, or intimidate a person in the United States in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\nDid Trump conspire against our rights as Americans to have our votes counted?\nWell, let’s be clear about what needs to be proven and what doesn’t.\nMany claim that as long as Trump truly believed election fraud at a level that was outcome determinative, he was within his right to do, I guess, literally he wanted to do.\nFortunately, this is not how the real world works. Conviction with no adherence to rule of law is simply vigilantism.\nMany people also speak of “intent”, but intent is not really at issue in the case that Jack Smith has brought to federal court. Or rather, not the “intent” of whether or not he believes the election was stolen.\nTake, for example, the false elector plot that Trump and his cronies concocted. Donald Trump and his team had 7 different groups of citizens in 7 different states affirm that they were in fact the duly appointed electors, authorized to transmit their state’s electoral college vote through NARA to Congress. This was a lie. They were not appointed by the state assemblies. They did not meet in the state capitols. And surely, they were not authorized to transmit those electoral votes under false pretenses to Congress to be counted on January 6th.\nTrump’s intent only matters insofar as he compelled these citizens to gather and lie about being the duly appointed state electors. They were not. Trump and his team compelled them to lie.\nIt may be that Donald Trump rightfully thought he had won the election, and that he thought there was corruption that the states simply hadn’t thoroughly investigated yet. Even if that were the case, though, it is not lawful for Trump and his team to compel others to lie about being state electors in the hope that their electoral votes will be counted as opposed to the legally certified electors. This is fraud.\nThe same is true with the infamous call he placed to Georgia Secretary of State Raffensperger, encouraging him to find 11,000 votes to help him flip the state. Even if he did believe there was election fraud, that gave him no right to call any election officials or state assemblies to pressure them to change the outcome of their elections.\nAnd what of 18 USC 1512? Do we believe that Trump attempted to corruptly obstruct an official proceeding?\nWell, we know he did. We know that Trump attempted to bully his own vice president into accepting the fraudulent elector slates, knowing they were sent under false pretense. This happened multiple times in the days and weeks proceeding January 6th. When rebuffed on a phone call on Christmas, Trump even seemed to admit to Pence that he knew he was being deceitful, telling him that he was “too honest” for refusing his plot. Again, even if Trump had thought there was outcome determinative election fraud, this was clearly not the legally acceptable avenue to address his grievances.\nAssuming even half the accusations laid out in these indictments are true, certainly Trump should be convicted of the aforementioned crimes, many of which carry with them prison sentences.\nDonald Trump acts as though he lives above the law, as though the Constitution and the American government exists not just beneath him, but at his whim  and pleasure, only necessary when convenient to him, and cast aside when it hampers his ambitions. It is important to send a message not just to Trump, nor those that support him, but to all future presidents and their supporters that this sort of injustice will not be tolerated.\nAs Americans, we should not accept that the armor of “ex-president” be protective against the sword of justice.\nOr, said more simply, lock him up."},"College-Resolutions/2024.02.07---Cornell-Political-Union/Cornell-Political-Union":{"title":"Cornell Political Union","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Resolution: Send More Military Aid to Ukraine and Israel to Uphold Global Justice\nThe year is 2024. We are not currently at war with Iraq nor Afghanistan. It’s important to remember this, because it feels as though we are collectively traumarized by the nation building exercises we undertook in these two countries, and it feels as though we are incapable of understanding any other conflict or imagining any other outcome than being quagmires for 20 years in a country that doesn’t really want us there.\nSupport for Ukraine is essential if America is be seen as the safeguard of democracy, economic prosperity, and a safe and secure Europe. Some still scoff at the idea of America being able to maintain any of these ideals around the world. While it’s true that our record is far from perfect, the reality is that someone will rise to the occasion of leading the world into the future if we will not.\nPerhaps you say America is not worthy, I’d challenge you, then: who? Russia, with Putin leading it into conquest after conquest, peeling territory away from states who don’t bow to Putin’s whims, such as in Moldova, Georgia, and now Ukraine? A country hell-bent on supporting Iran, and all of their terrorist proxies in the Middle East? A man who destroys entire cities, like in Aleppo and Mariupol, as he conducts warfare with zero regard for human life?\nWould you trust China to lead the world? A country on the precipice of conflict with Taiwan, a country who also stands accused of the forcible removal and genocidal destruction of the Uyghur population for its own territorial conquest?\nSupport for Ukraine is essential to the United States for 3 key reasons:\nFirstly, support for Ukraine is a resounding “NO” to Russia’s imperialistic conquest in parts of the world. Why should we stand for Russia unilaterally deciding that they alone have a right to destroy the borders of a country that the entire world, Russia included, recognized in 1991? All of us made promises to the territorial integrity of Ukraine. And again in 1994 as part of the Budapest Memorandums, when we promised Ukraine the integrity of their borders in exchange for their decaying nuclear arsenal, left there with the collapse of the Soviet Union. What message is sent to the rest of the world if we were not to ensure their sovereignty? Every country would understand that the only way to guarantee your borders would be through the acquisition of nuclear weapons or cowering under the nuclear umbrella of another country’s warheads.\nSecondly, supporting Ukraine allows us to fight in one of the most direct ways possible against an enemy that we all should stand in opposition to. If Ukraine were to regain control of her entire borders, Crimea included, Russia would no longer have free and unconditional access to the Black Sea, and, consequently, the rest of the world in the Winter time. Russia’s power projection would be severely hampered, forcing them to engage in diplomatic and economic negotiations more, as opposed to militaristic conquest. Russia would no longer as easily support Iran, fund and or deliver arms to terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah and the Houthis, and would no longer be able to as easily support Assad as he unleashes chemical attacks and devastation upon his own people. Never will the United States have an opportunity to so cheaply and easily provide weaponry in a conflict that will drain Russia of its capacity to terrorize the world in the future.\nThirdly, and, most importantly, we should support Ukraine because it’s the right thing to do. In this conflict, the moral authority rests with the Ukrainians. I find it noteworthy that, when we speak about the Ukraine-Russia word, we only speak of what’s in the interest of America, and sometimes our European allies. What of the Ukrainians, though, who’s will to fight remains unbroken? Are they not to have any say whatsoever in the future of their country, or their borders? If they have the personnel to fight, are we to deprive them of the material to do so if we can so easily provide it? If we do indeed agree, as we should, that Ukraine has the right to fight for their territorial integrity, why would we not provide the means to do so for as long as they have the will to fight?\nSupport for Ukraine is not only strategically important, it is of vital moral necessity that we continue to support Ukraine in their desire to reassert their borders.\nIsrael provides an interesting example where America’s influence exists not just to provide unlimited military support for an ally, but to force restraint. Israel obviously needs no support from the United States to defeat her enemies today, but the support we provide can condition her to act in a more humanitarian way.\nThe United States has forced Israel at times to slow her aggression in the Gaza Strip, giving more time for civilians to evacuate, to allow humanitarian aid into Gazan corridors, and, recently, Biden has applied pressure to the West Bank settlements, levying harsh penalties on settlers accused of violence against Palestinians in the forms of sanctions.\nIf the United States were to diplomatically and financially withdraw from this region, why would Israel halt or pause any of their aggression? Historically, Israel has been forced to show restraint as well due to pressure from the US, such as withdrawing the Sinai in 1956 after hostilities had escalated with Russia.\nThe Ukrainians have a right to have their borders defended, and the US is in the best place to help them militarily. If we value at all the lives of Palestinians, the US is one of the only countries that could force Israel to show restraint, so we ought to continue to do so.\nWhile I’m sympathetic towards those who remain skeptical of US foreign policy after our Middle Eastern blunders of recent decades, it shouldn’t cause us to turn a blind eye to every conflict where the US may intervene in a righteous way. If we have any responsibility to the world, it should be to help nations def weend themselves."},"Debate-Prep/2024.01.06---Jones-and-Greenwald-Debate/2022.12.022---FINAL-REPORT-OF-THE-SELECT-COMMITTEE-TO-INVESTIGATE-THE-JANUARY-6TH-ATTACK-ON-THE-UNITED-STATES-CAPITOL":{"title":"2022.12.022 - FINAL REPORT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE THE JANUARY 6TH ATTACK ON THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Composition\n\nFormation - Wikipedia\n\nOn May 19th, 2021, the House voted to form an independent bicameral commission to investigate the Jan 6th insurrection.\n\nVote passed 252-175 with 35 Republicans joining in favor.\n\n\nSenate Republicans blocked the bicameral commission, leading to House Speaker Pelosi to appoint a select committee using only House members.\nOn June 30th, 2021, House Resolution 503 “Establishing the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on teh United States Capitol” passed the House 222-190.

Such access is particularly inappropriate when former officials have transitioned into highly partisan positions and seek to use real or perceived access to sensitive information to validate their political attacks. Any access granted to our Nation’s secrets should be in furtherance of national, not personal, interests.&quot;&quot;\n\n\n\n\nTrump was personally involved in the transportation of his documents to Mar-a-Lago.\nTrump’s documents were, for a time, stored publicly in the Mar-a-Lago Club’s White and Gold Ballroom, where events and gatherings took place.\nPhotographs were taken of boxes toppled over in the storage room with classified information both available for view and texted back and forth between employees and lawyers.\nIn May of 2022, Nauta made false and misleading statements to the FBI\n\nLied about being aware of Trump reviewing the material in his boxes.\nLied about knowing how the boxes got to the residence.\nLied about knowing where the boxes were stored.\n\n\nOf the 15 boxes Trump provided NARA in January of 2022, 14 boxes contained 197 classified documents, 98 were marked “SECRET”, 30 were marked “TOP SECRET”, and the remainder were marked “CONFIDENTIAL.”\nIn response to a grand jury subpoena, Trump told his attorneys\n\nI don’t want anybody looking, I don’ t want anybody looking through my boxes, I really don ‘t, I don’ t want you looking through my boxes.\nWell what if we, what happens if we just don ‘t respond at all or don ‘t play ball with them?\nWouldn’t it be better if we just told them we don’t have anything here?\nWell look isn’t it better if there are no documents?\n\n\nWhile meeting with attorney’s, Trump told the following story:\n\nAttorney, he was great, he did a great job. You know what? He said, he said that it - that it was him. That he was the one who deleted all of her emails, the 30,000 emails, because they basically dealt with her scheduling and her going to the gym and her having beauty appointments. And he was great. And he, so she didn’t get in any trouble because he said that he was the one who deleted them.\n\n\nTrump demanded to be present and changed his travel plans accordingly to oversee the attorneys going through his boxes to search for classified material.\nBetween May 23rd and June 2nd, Trump instructed Nauta to remove a total of ~64 boxes from the storage room and to bring them to Trump’s residence.\n\nOn May 24, 2022, between 5:30 p.m. and 5:38 p.m., NAUTA removed three boxes from the Storage Room.\nOn May 30, 2022, at 9:08 a.m., TRUMP and NAUTA spoke by phone for approximately 30 seconds. Between I0:02 a.m. and 11:51a.m., NAUTA removed a total of approximately 50 boxes from the Storage Room.\n\n\nTrump implied to Attorney 1 to discard any particularly sensitive classified material.\n\nHe made a funny motion as though - well okay why don’t you take them with you to your hotel room and if there’s anything really bad in there, like, you know, pluck it out. And that was the motion that he made. He didn’t say that.\n\n\nTrump took classified material that he and Nauta thought were important or relevant and packed them on a plane and flew them north for Trump’s Summer vacation.\nIn June, after a request for camera footage in Mar-a-Lago, Trump likely instructed Nauta to return to Mar-a-Lago and delete security camera footage.\n\n\nTimeline\n\nBeginning in March 2021, NARA repeatedly demanded that Trump turn over records.\nOn January 17th, of 2022, after months of demands from NARA, Trump provided only 15 boxes/197 documents with classification markings.\nOn February 9th, 2022, NARA

knew that the outcomes of elections were wrong, and that Georgia had two valid slates of electors transmitting their votes to Congress, urging the state legislature to convene a special session to hopefully choose the fraudulent electors of the legitimate ones.\n\nJeffery Clark on the 2nd said Trump would make him the acting AG if the AG and deputy AG refused to sign the letter.\n\n\nTrump only

Presidential advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner recounted others giving Donald Trump the same advice.\n\nDonald Trump won in numerous States that allowed no-excuse absentee voting in 2020, including Alaska, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Wyoming.\n\n\n\n\nPeople knew ahead of time that Trump was going to attempt to claim victory early.\n\nSteve Bannon: And what Trump’s gonna do is just declare victory, right? He’s gonna declare victory. But that doesn’t mean he’s a winner. He’s just gonna say he’s a winner … The Democrats—more of our people vote early that count. Theirs vote in mail. And so they’re gonna have a natural disadvantage, and Trump’s going to take advantage of it—that’s our strategy. He’s gonna declare himself a winner. So when you wake up Wednesday morning, it’s going to be a firestorm … . Also, if Trump, if Trump is losing, by 10 or 11 o’clock at night, it’s going to be even crazier. No, because he’s gonna sit right there and say “They stole it. I’m directing the Attorney General to shut down all ballot places in all 50 states.” It’s going to be, no, he’s not going out easy. If Trump—if Biden’s winning, Trump is going to do some crazy shit.\nRoger Stone: I really do suspect it will still be up in the air. When that happens, the key thing to do is to claim victory. Possession is nine-tenths of the law. No, we won. Fuck you, Sorry. Over. We won. You’re wrong. Fuck you.\nOn election day, Vice President Pence’s staff, including his Chief of Staff and Counsel, became concerned that President Trump might falsely claim victory that evening. The Vice President’s Counsel, Greg Jacob, testified about their concern that the Vice President might be asked improperly to echo such a false statement. Jacob drafted a memorandum with this specific recommendation: “It is essential that the Vice President not be perceived by the public as having decided questions concerning disputed electoral votes prior to the full development of all relevant facts.”\n\n\nOn election night\n\nStepien: You know, very, very, very bleak. You know, I—we told him—the group that went over there outlined, you know, my belief and chances for success at this point. And then we pegged that at, you know, 5, maybe 10 percent based on recounts that were—that, you know, either were automatically initiated or could be—could be initiated based on, you know, realistic legal challenges, not all the legal challenges that eventually were pursued. But, you know, it was—you know, my belief is that it was a very, very—5 to 10 percent is not a very good optimistic outlook.\nMiller: I was in the Oval Office. And at some point in the conversation Matt Oczkowski, who was the lead data person, was brought on, and I remember he delivered to the President in pretty blunt terms that he was going to lose.\nPresident Trump refused, and instead said this in his public remarks that evening: “This is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country. We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election. We did win this election … . We want all voting to stop.” And on the morning of November 5th, he tweeted “STOP THE COUNT!” Halting the counting of votes at that point would have violated both State and Federal laws.\n\nWilliam Barr: “Right out of the box on election night, the President claimed that there was major fraud underway. I mean, this happened, as far as I could tell, before there was actually any potential of looking at evidence. He claimed there was major fraud. And it seemed to be based on the dynamic that, at the end of the evening, a lot of Democratic votes came in which changed the vote counts in certain States, and that seemed to be the basis for this broad claim that there was major fraud. And I didn’t think much of that, because people had been talking for weeks and everyone understood for weeks that that was going to be what happened on election night … .”\n\n\nIn one of the Select Committee’s hearings, former Fox News political editor Chris Stirewalt was asked what the chance President Trump had of winning the election after November 7th, when the votes were tallied andevery news organization had called the race for now-President Biden. His response: “None.”\n\n\nAfter the election\n\nAs the Committee’s hearings demonstrated, President Trump made a series of statements to White House staff and others during this time period indicating his understanding that he had lost.50 President Trump also took consequential actions reflecting his understanding that he would be leaving office on January 20th. For example, President Trump personally signed a Memorandum and Order instructing his Department of Defense to withdraw all military forces from Somalia by December 31, 2020, and from Afghanistan by January 15, 2021.51 General Keith Kellogg (ret.), who had been appointed by President Trump as Chief of Staff for the National Security Council and was Vice President Pence’s National Security Advisor on January 6th, told the Select Committee that “an immediate departure that that memo said would have been catastrophic. It’s the same thing what President Biden went through. It would have been a debacle.”\nBarr: And I repeatedly told the President in no uncertain terms that I did not see evidence of fraud, you know, that would have affected the outcome of the election. And, frankly, a year and a half later, I haven’t seen anything to change my mind on that.\nExchange between Staff and Stepien\n\nCommittee Staff: How did he react to those types of conversations where you told him that an allegation or another wasn’t true?\nStepien: He was—he had—usually he had pretty clear eyes. Like, he understood, you know—you know, we told him where we thought the race was, and I think he was pretty realistic with our viewpoint, in agreement with our viewpoint of kind of the forecast and the uphill climb we thought he had.\n\n\nTrump Campaign Senior Advisor Jason Miller told the Committee that he informed President Trump “several” times that “specific to election day fraud and irregularities, there were not enough to overturn the election.”\nPence: There was never evidence of widespread fraud. I don’t believe fraud changed the outcome of the election. But the President and the Campaign had every right to have those examined in court. But I told the President that, once those legal challenges played out, he should simply accept the outcome of the election and move on.\nThe General Counsel of President Trump’s campaign, Matthew Morgan: What was generally discussed on that topic was whether the fraud, maladministration, abuse, or irregularities, if aggregated and read most favorably to the campaign, would that be outcome determinative. And I think everyone’s assessment in the room, at least amongst the staff, Marc Short, myself, and Greg Jacob, was that it was not sufficient to be outcome determinative.\nA group of prominent Republicans have more recently issued a report—titled Lost, Not Stolen—examining “every count of every case brought in these six battleground states” by President Trump and his allies. The report concludes “that Donald Trump and his supporters had their day in court and failed to produce substantive evidence to make their case.” President Trump and his legal allies “failed because of a lack of evidence and not because of erroneous rulings or unfair judges … . In many cases, after making extravagant claims of wrongdoing, Trump’s legal representatives showed up in court or state proceedings empty-handed, and then returned to their rallies and media campaigns to repeat the same unsupported claims.”\nIndeed, eleven of the judges who ruled against Donald Trump and his supporters were appointed by Donald Trump himself.\nOne of those Trump nominees, Judge Stephanos Bibas of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, rejected an appeal by the Trump Campaign claiming that Pennsylvania officials “did not undertake any meaningful effort” to fight illegal absentee ballots and uneven treatment of voters across counties. Judge Bibas wrote in his decision that “calling an election unfair does not make it so. Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here.” Another Trump nominee, Judge Brett Ludwig of the Eastern District of Wisconsin, ruled against President Trump’s lawsuit alleging that the result was skewed by illegal procedures that governed drop boxes, ballot address information, and individuals who claimed“ indefinitely confined” status to vote from home. Judge Ludwig wrote in his decision, that “this Court has allowed plaintiff the chance to make his case and he has lost on the merits” because the procedures used “do not remotely rise to the level” of breaking Wisconsin’s election rules.\nNor is it true that these rulings focused solely on standing, or procedural issues. As Ginsberg confirmed in his testimony to the Select Committee, President Trump’s team “did have their day in court.” Indeed, he and his co-authors determined in their report that  of these post-election cases were dismissed by a judge after an evidentiary hearing had been held, and many of these judges explicitly indicated in their decisions that the evidence presented by the plaintiffs was wholly insufficient on the merits.\nNot a single witness ever provided proof to the J6 committee that fraud existed on any reasonable scale in any state.\n\n\n\nUndermining the Electoral Process\n\n“Beginning election night and continuing through January 6th and thereafter, Donald Trump purposely disseminated false allegations of fraud related to the 2020 Presidential election in order to aid his effort to overturn the election and for purposes of soliciting contributions. These false claims provoked his supporters to violence on January 6th.”\n“Despite knowing that such an action would be illegal, and that no State had or would submit an altered electoral slate, Donald Trump corruptly pressured Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes during Congress’s joint session on January 6th.”\n“Donald Trump sought to corrupt the U.S. Department of Justice by attempting to enlist Department officials to make purposely false statements and thereby aid his effort to overturn the Presidential election. After that effort failed, Donald Trump offered the position of Acting Attorney General to Jeff Clark knowing that Clark intended to disseminate false information aimed at overturning the election.”\n“. Without any evidentiary basis and contrary to State and Federal law, Donald Trump unlawfully pressured State officials and legislators to change the results of the election in their States.”\n“Donald Trump oversaw an effort to obtain and transmit false electoral certificates to Congress and the National Archives.”\n“Donald Trump pressured Members of Congress to object to valid slates of electors from several States.\n\nPlan to Overturn Election Results\n\n“Knowing that he and his supporters had lost dozens of election lawsuits, and despite his own senior advisors refuting his election fraud claims and urging him to concede his election loss, Donald Trump refused to accept the lawful result of the 2020 election. Rather than honor his constitutional obligation to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,” President Trump instead plotted to overturn the election outcome.”\n\nSpeech on January 6th\n\n“Based on false allegations that the election was stolen, Donald Trump summoned tens of thousands of supporters to Washington for January 6th. Although these supporters were angry and some were armed, Donald Trump instructed them to march to the Capitol on January 6th to “take back” their country.”\n\nThe Protest\nTimeline\nDeaths on January 6\nActions of coordinated groups\nPolice allowed protestors in\nPotential FBI Involvement\n\n\nRay Epps\n\n\nDonald Trump’s failure to act\nAftermath\nProsecutions\nDonald Trump Impeachment\nDominion Case\nwww.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/trump-incited-january-6-defendants/\nTucker Carlson\nWhitmer Kidnapping Attempt\nComparison to BLM stuff\nDonald Trump Speech Transcript\n\nwww.npr.org/2021/02/10/966396848/read-trumps-jan-6-speech-a-key-part-of-impeachment-trial\nDonald Trump Speech\nwww.youtube.com/watch\n\nal gore toss out votes???\nLAWSUITS FOR ELECTION THINGS FROM RUDOLPH GIULIANA, how many of these did Trump’s campaign file?\n\npage 237 for case breakdown\n\nwww.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/18uri2p/weird_how_biden_won_alot_of_these_states_in_2020/\n\nTrump was never calling people to violence\nHe just wanted people to vote out their leaders\nWho caused it?

Trump knew these claims were false. What would it take to convince you that Trump was making knowingly false claims? Would we apply this same standard to other people (e.g. Hillary’s emails)? What about Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham in private texts saying they didn’t believe Powell’s claim of Election Fraud?\n\nTrump won in states with no-excuse absentee voting in 2020, including Alaska, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Wyoming. He had no reason to believe absentee voting was rigged or corrupt.\nTrump would repeat election fraud claims that had been widely debunked, many times just days after being informed and being shown evidence that they had been debunked.\nAll of these people were trusted by Trump to investigate claims of election fraud:\n\nBill Stepien, Trump’s National Field Director for his campaign, a lifelong Republican, who also worked on Giuliana’s presidential campaign in 2007-2008, told Trump he had lost on election night.\nChris Miller, Trump’s Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, attested that Matt Oczkowski, Trump’s campaign’s top data scientist, told him on election night that he was going to lose.\nWilliam Barr, Trump’s Attorney General of the Department of Justice, told Trump repeatedly that he’d investigated and found absolutely no signs of voter fraud.\nJeffry Rosen, Trump’s acting Attorney General of the Department of Justice, called or met with Trump only ever day to tell him there was no election fraud.\nRichard Donoghue, Trump’s acting attorney general, told Trump the information he was getting was false.\nChris Stirewalt, former Fox New political editor, said that Trump had no chance of winning the election after the votes were counted.\nJason Miller, the Trump Campaign Senior Advisor, informed Trump several times that there wasn’t enough evidence of fraud to overturn the election.\n\n“When our research and campaign legal team can’t back up any of the claims made by our Elite Strike Force Legal Team, you can see why we’re 0-32 on our cases. I’ll obviously hustle to help on all fronts, but it’s tough to own any of this when it’s all just conspiracy shit beamed down from the mothership.”\n\n\nMike Pence, Trump’s Vice President, said there was never evidence of widespread fraud, and that he believed there was no good evidence of enough fraud to overturn the election.\nMatthew Morgan, the General Counsel of Trump’s campaign, claimed that the Trump staff, including him and Marc Short and Greg Jacob, didn’t believe there was sufficient evidence of voter fraud.\nBrad Raffensperger, the Republican Georgia Secretary of State, denied every single claim that Trump made about election Fraud.\nBrian Kemp, the Republican Governor of Georgia, denied that the election was stolen in Georgia.\nA group of prominent Republicans (4 Federal Judges, 2 former Senators, a lawyer and someone who worked on Capitol Hill for 20 years) published a conservative report, titled Lost, Not Stolen, which claimed\n\nThe report concludes “that Donald Trump and his supporters had their day in court and failed to produce substantive evidence to make their case.” President Trump and his legal allies “failed because of a lack of evidence and not because of erroneous rulings or unfair judges … . In many cases, after making extravagant claims of wrongdoing, Trump’s legal representatives showed up in court or state proceedings empty-handed, and then returned to their rallies and media campaigns to repeat the same unsupported claims.”\n\n\nEleven of the judges who ruled against Trump were Trump federal judiciary appointments.\n\nOne of those Trump nominees, Judge Stephanos Bibas of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, rejected an appeal by the Trump Campaign claiming that Pennsylvania officials “did not undertake any meaningful effort” to fight illegal absentee ballots and uneven treatment of voters across counties. Judge Bibas wrote in his decision that “calling an election unfair does not make it so. Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here.” Another Trump nominee, Judge Brett Ludwig of the Eastern District of Wisconsin, ruled against President Trump’s lawsuit alleging that the result was skewed by illegal procedures that governed drop boxes, ballot address information, and individuals who claimed“ indefinitely confined” status to vote from home. Judge Ludwig wrote in his decision, that “this Court has allowed plaintiff the chance to make his case and he has lost on the merits” because the procedures used “do not remotely rise to the level” of breaking Wisconsin’s election rules.\n\n\nIvanka and Kushner, Trump’s daughter and son-in-law, prepared to move right after the election, with Ivanka stating she believed Barr’s testimony.\nAlex Cannon, Trump’s campaign lawyer, said he told advisers that there was no election fraud.\nKellyanne Conway, Trump’s counselor, wrote in her published memoir that she had told Trump he lost.\n\n“The team had failed on November 3, and they failed again afterward. By not confronting the candidate with the grim reality of his situation, that the proof had not surfaced to support the claims, they denied him the evidence he sought and the respect he was due. Instead supplicant after sycophant after showman genuflected in front of the Resolute Desk and promised the president goods they could not deliver.”\n\n\nKen Block, a data mining firm hired by Donald Trump to find evidence of voter fraud, said they found very little evidence of voter fraud, and that it was equal on the Democratic and Republican side.\n\n\nTrump’s campaign filed 62 suits and lost 61 of them, 30 of them due to not even having adequate evidence to bring a suit forward, and most of them asking for insane or unreasonable remedies.\n\nThe one suit was a victory in Pennsylvania, which allowed voters to not go back and “cure” ballots if they had failed to provide identification. The ruling did not change the outcome in Pennsylvania.\n\n\nDonald Trump called Georgia and Michigan making false claims in order to make them decertify their vote.\n\nTrump makes a litany of false claims that have all been rejected by Raffensberger in his call to Georgia. After the call, Trump’s mischaracterization of the call lead to Raffensberger leaking it to the public.\nTrump and Giuliana called Republican Senate Majority leader Mike Shirkey and Republican House Speaker Lee Chatfield and repeated more false claims to them about the election, which both said had been investigated and denied. In response, Trump and his team maliciously tweeted out Shirkey’s personal cell phone number and a number for Chatfield for people to spam. Shirkey said he received nearly 4,000 text messages..\n\n\n\n\n\nDonald Trump created and implemented a fake elector scheme to undermine the legitimate state electors. There was never any compelling reason to believe any part of this scheme was legal. Would we feel the same if Biden had refused to certify the vote for Trump because of “Russia Collusion?” What about Gore refusing to certify the vote over the Florida recounts in 2000? What if Kamala Harris refuses to certify the vote for Trump?\n\nDonald Trump and his team enticed 7 sets of electors to fraudulently fill out ballots and transmit them to NARA, falsely claiming that they were the duly appointed electors authorized to transmit the votes. They lied about being the duly appointed electors and they lied about meeting in the State Capitols to certify their votes.\nAccording to the first Eastman memo, Mike Pence would read and count through the ballots, declare that there are multiple sets of electors for the 7 states that Trump had false electors set in for, then declare that no sets of electors can be declared valid. At this point, Trump would have 232 EC votes to Biden’s 222, making him the winner. If the Democrats claim 270, a majority of votes, is required, Pence can throw the vote back to the House of Representatives, where each state gets one vote on who the president should be. Republicans had 26 states controlled in the senate, meaning Trump could still win the election with their votes.\n\nEastman had already said prior to this that the strategy was not valid. He told Greg Jacobs, Mike Pence’s legal counsel, that the Supreme Court would reject his legal theory, 9-0.\n\n“I don’t agree with this. The 12th Amendment only says that the President of the Senate opens the ballots in the joint session then, in the passive voice, that the votes shall then be counted. 3 USC § 12 of the Electoral Count Act says merely that he is the presiding officer, and then it spells out specific procedures, presumptions, and default rules for which slates will be counted. Nowhere does it suggest that the president of the Senate gets to make the determination on his own. § 15 of the Electoral Count Act doesn’t either.”\n\n\nPence’s private counsel, Richard Cullen, contacted former Fourth Circuit Judge Michael Luttig, a conservative judge that Eastman previously clerked for. Luttig testified there was no basis in law for Eastman’s theory.\n\nJudge Luttig completely rejected Eastman’s “blueprint to overturn the 2020 election” as “constitutional mischief” and ‘the most reckless, insidious, and calamitous failure[ ] in both legal and political judgment in American history.”\n\n\nPat Cipollone, White House Counsel for Donald Trump, said that the idea to overturn the election using Mike Pence was crazy.\nEric Herschmann, another White House lawyer, said the plan was “completely crazy” and “obviously made no sense.”\nPat Philbin, Deputy White House Counsel, also had the same understanding that the plan wasn’t possible.\n\n\nThe second Eastman memo claimed that Pence himself could make the determination as to which slates of electors were legitimate.\n\n\n\nEstablish that Donald Trump attempted to bully Pence into unilaterally overturning the election. Is it in the spirit of the Constitution to ask Pence to toss out electoral slates? What is the difference at this point between Trump and an authoritarian?\n\nTrump asked Pence multiple times to commit to this course of action. Pence and his legal counsel responded negatively, every single time.\n\nIn a January 1st call, Trump told Pence he was “too honest” after he explained that he did not have the power to unilaterally determine the outcome of the election.\n\n\nTrump tweeted multiple times and called out in his January 6th speech multiple times for Pence to “do the right thing.” He continued these tweets even as the riots raged on, leading to protestors chanting “Bring him out!” and “Hang Mike Pence!&quot;&quot;\n\n\n\nEstablish that Donald Trump capitalized on the Jan. 6th riot to continue his pressure to decertify the election. Why would Trump not want to stop the riots if they weren’t his intention? Shouldn’t he be doing everything within his power to stop the riots if they were going to make him look bad? Why were the rioters chanting 1776, what were they sent to the Capitol by Donald Trump to protest?\n\nTrump was getting a play-by-play update on everything going on at the Capitol, with people begging him to call off the rioters.\n\nMinutes after arriving back at the White House, a White House staffer informed him of the rioting. This happened at 1:21 PM.\nBen Williamson, the White House Acting Director of Communications, and Sarah Matthews, the Deputy Press Secretary, went to Mark Meadows and Kayleigh McEnany to urge the president to issue a statement.\nHutchinson, Kushner and Cipollone all tried to convince Trump to put out a statement to stop the rioters.\nMark Meadows and Dan Scavino, the two who spent the most time with Trump during the Capitol Riots, both refused to respond to subpoenas about their interactions with Trump that day.\nMcCarthy told Trump in a call from 2:26 to 3:06 that he needed to put a stop to this. Trump said “Well, Kevin, I guess they’re just more upset about the election theft than you are.”\nMarjorie Taylor Green texted Meadows at 2:28 PM: “Mark I was just told there is an active shooter on the first floor of the Capitol Please tell the President to calm people. This isn’t the way to solve anything.”\nLaura Ingram, at 2:32 PM: “Hey Mark, The president needs to tell people in the Capitol to go home.” “This is hurting all of us.” “He is destroying his legacy and playing into every stereotype … we lose all credibility against the BLM/Antifa crowd if things go South.” “You can tell him I said this.”\nMick Mulvaney at 2:35 PM, “Mark: he needs to stop this, now. Can I do anything to help?”\nRepresentative Barry Loudermilk, 2:24 PM: ““It’s really bad up here on the hill.” “They have breached the Capitol.”232 At 2:48 p.m., Meadows responded: “POTUS is engaging.”233 At 2:49 p.m., Loudermilk responded: “Thanks. This doesn’t help our cause.”\nRepresentative William Timmons, 2:46 PM: “The president needs to stop this ASAP.”235 At 2:49 p.m., Meadows responded: “We are doing it.”\nDonald Trump Jr., 2:53 PM: ““He’s got to condem [sic] this shit. Asap. The captiol [sic] police tweet is not enough.”237 Meadows responded: “I am pushing it hard. I agree.”238 Later, Trump, Jr., continued: “This his [sic] one you go to the mattresses on. They will try to fuck his entire legacy on this if it gets worse.””\nIvanka went into the room to also tell Trump to call off the rioters, having to regroup in Kushner’s office at times in between going into the room to request he call off the rioters.\n\n\nMost of Trump’s tweets were provocative, and he tried to continue to pressure Congress not to certify the vote.\n\nTrump’s first tweet at 2:24 PM. “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth!&quot;&quot;\nAt 2:38 PM, Trump tweeted “Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!”\n\n\nTrump and Giuliani were trying to make phone calls to talk about the EC votes during the riots.\n\nAt 2:26 PM Trump called Tommy Tuberville of Alabama to talk objections to the electoral count.\nFrom 2:26 to 3:06, Trump spoke to McCarthy.\nAfter Trump’s phone call with Giuliani, Giuliani began to call Members of Congress to talk about delaying the certification of the vote.\n\nHe called Senator Marsha Blackburn, Senator Mike Lee, three calls to Senator Bill Hagerty, two calls to Jim Jordan, Senator Lindsey Graham, Senator Josh Hawley, and Senator Ted Cruz.\nGiuliani testified that he was calling to see if anything could be done about the vote. One of the voicemails he left to Senator Tuberville was:\n\n“The only strategy we can follow is to object to numerous States and raise issues so that we get ourselves into tomorrow—ideally until the end of tomorrow. So if you could object to every State and, along with a congressman, get a hearing for every State, I know we would delay you a lot, but it would give us the opportunity to get the legislators who are very, very close to pulling their vote.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid Trump betray his people?\n\nAlex Jones and others said he would show up, he never did.\nWhy didn’t Trump pardon any of them? Why did he call them Antifa?\nTrump only pardoned those close to him, he is the swamp.\n\n4 years have passed since the last election. All of the investigations and court cases to find significant voter fraud have completely failed, yet Donald Trump still believes that significant voter fraud existed. Why should we believe that if the J6ers managed to delay the certification of the vote for additional investigations, that Donald Trump would believe anything that disagrees with his assumption that he won the election? Why would we expect him to leave office and not just continue to push to investigate more and more and more and more?"},"Debate-Prep/2024.01.06---Jones-and-Greenwald-Debate/Ray-Epps":{"title":"Ray Epps","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\n\nThe Claims\n\nRay Epps led the very first “breach team” on January 6th\nThe FBI stealthily removed Ray Epps from its Capitol Violence Most Wanted List on July 1st\nRay Epps worked alongside several individuals, many of whom were suspiciously unindicted\nRay Epps has never been charged with a crime\n\nRay Epps pleaded guilty to Jan. 6th misdemeanor (Indictment)\n\nProsecutor alleges that Epps had no connection to the FBI.\nUnclear why Justice Department decided to charge him with a crime 2½ years after the events of January 6th.\n\n\n\n\nStewart Rhodes was an inexplicitly protected Jan 6th instigator who founded the Oath Keepers and led the conspiracy to revolt.\n\nRhodes was convicted to 18 years in prison for seditious conspiracy.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\nIf Ray Epps was a known FBI informant, why did they mess up and publish him on their FBI Washington Field Twitter account and their most wanted list?\nDid Ray Epps actually make any commands on the day of January 6th?\nIf Baked Alaska was so intelligent in being able to point out that Ray Epps was a “glowie” issuing illegal commands to people, why the fuck did he actually then proceed to enter the Capitol building the next day???\nWhy didn’t the FBI scrub Epps’ presence before choosing him for this essential mission?\nWhy did Epps himself confess to his local newspaper about being at the J6 protests?\nWhy did the FBI so blatantly remove Suspect 16 and not replace him with another photo, change the numbering of everyone on the site, or just leave him up so as to not draw obvious suspicion?\nWhy wouldn’t the FBI just block webcrawlers like the wayback machine like so many other sites have???\nWhy wouldn’t the FBI have just arrested Epps immediately to hide suspicion?\nWhy wouldn’t they take down all the videos posted online about him if they controlled platforms like Twitter?\nWhy is Ray Epps intelligent enough to infiltrate the January 6th protests, instigate riots, and coordinate the first breach of the Capitol grounds, but stupid enough to text his nephew claiming he orchestrated it?\n\n\n\nCOUNTER NARRATIVE\n\nBoomer guy who believed that Trump genuinely thought the election was stolen, so he showed up to protest in the Capitol, but wanted things to remain peaceful.\nProbably didn’t have any active major connections, and probably wasn’t involved in any violent coordination.\n"},"Debate-Prep/2024.01.24---Ben-Shapiro-Debate/2023.10.05---Ben-Shapiro-video-on-Who-Wants-to-be-Speaker-of-the-House":{"title":"2023.10.05 - Ben Shapiro video on Who Wants to be Speaker of the House","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"YouTube Link\n\n4:50 - “Donald Trump backed a bunch of really bad candidates in Purple Districts.”\n\nGiving one strong reason why Trump is a bad leader.

Unlike previous seasonal influenza viruses, this pandemic influenza virus disproportionately infects a wider age-range of people. Based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) recommendations, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has guidelines for employers to assist them in the development of a framework in preparing their workplaces in order to minimize transmission of a pandemic virus.\nOSHA does expect facilities providing healthcare services to perform a risk assessment of their workplace and encourages healthcare employers to offer both the seasonal and H1N1 vaccines. It is important to note that employees need to be properly informed of the benefits of the vaccinations. However, although OSHA does not specifically require employees to take the vaccines, an employer may do so. In that case, an employee who refuses vaccination because of a reasonable belief that he or she has a medical condition that creates a real danger of serious illness or death (such as serious reaction to the vaccine) may be protected under Section 11(c) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 pertaining to whistle blower rights.\nSource: www.osha.gov/laws-regs/standardinterpretations/2009-11-09\nen.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_Hall_Putsch\n“As Hitler controlled the masses support for the political right, the conservative elite believed that they could use Hitler and his popular support to ‘democratically’ take power. Once in power, Hitler could destroy the political left.  Destroying the political left would help to remove the majority of political opponents to the ring-wing conservative elite.\nOnce Hitler had removed the left-wing socialist opposition and destroyed the Weimar Republic, the conservative elite thought they would be able to replace Hitler, and appoint a leader of their choice.”\n\nRead this and thought it might be a useful line of attack for the biden/trump debate. Beyond policy, what about character, values, and real leadership?\nryanholiday.net/letter/\nSome quotes:\n“Was it stupid that, in February, Trump was tweeting about how Covid-19 was like the flu and that we didn’t need to worry? Yes, but it takes on a different color when you listen to him tell Bob Woodward that in January he knew how bad it was, how much worse it was than even the worst flu, and that he was deliberately going to downplay the virus for political purposes.”\n“I guess I just always thought you believed in the lessons you taught me, and the things we used to listen to on talk radio on our drives home from the lake. All those conversations about American dignity, the power of private enterprise, the sacredness of the Oval Office, the primacy of the rule of law.”\n“If Donald Trump were even half-competent, one elected official told me, he could probably rule this country for 20 years. I have trouble figuring what’s worse—that he wants to, or that he wants to but isn’t competent enough to pull it off. Instead, Washington is so broken and so filled with cowards that Trump just spent the last four years breaking stuff and embarrassing himself.”\n“Or is it worse, that my own father cares more about his retirement accounts—and I’ll grant, the runup of the market has been nice for me, too—than the future he is leaving for his children? Are you so afraid of change, of that liberal boogeyman Limbaugh and Hannity and these other folks have concocted, that you’d rather entrust the country to a degenerate carnival barker than anyone else? I see all this anger, what is it that you’re so angry about? You’ve won. Society has worked for you. My own success is proof.”\n“So what is it? Because it can’t possibly be that you think this guy is trustworthy, decent, or kind. It’s definitely not about his policies… because almost every single one is anathema to what Republicans—and you—have talked about my entire life.”\nwww.youtube.com/watch\nwww.youtube.com/watch\nDON’T LET THE “trump is just dumb lol” ARGUMENT EVER FLY"},"Debate-Prep/2024.02.28---Finkelstein-and-Rabbani/Debate-Outline":{"title":"Debate Outline","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Palestine: Norm Finkelstein, Mouin Rabbani\nIsrael: Benny Morris, Steven Bonnell (Destiny)\nRhetorical notes\n\nStop hedging so much.\nAlways restate narratives as much as possible during questions and responses.\n\nMake sure to maintain chain of argumentation from before and after every question and answer to maintain causal chains.\n\n\n\nPrimary Claims\n\nBritain over-promised the same land to two people. Jewish people bought tracts of land in Palestine from willing Arab sellers even before British guarantees to a right to settle in Palestine. It’s inarguable that the Arabs living within the borders of Mandatory Palestine felt betrayed by the British. The Jewish people, however, were betrayed as well. In the wake of the perceived British betrayal, and in the aftermath of the Holocaust, both sides would have felt justified in fighting the other for control over this land. At some point, however, it must be recognized that Israel emerged from the fighting in this region victorious, and surrounding Arab states were forced to recognize Israel as a legitimate entity.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nFactual Disagreement - It is incorrect to state that incoming Jews were clearly in the wrong, and that they were a colonial project by Great Britain.\nMoral Significance: It is important to recognize that the founding of Israel represented promises made to both Jewish citizens and Ottoman Empire subjects because it illustrates the moral fallibility of assigning blame in the early stages of the Mandatory Palestine period to either the Jews or the Arabs. Blame should be more heavily assigned to Great Britain.\n\n\nThis factual and moral claim is literally found in the first 1964 PLO Covenant, written by the first PLO Chairman, Ahmed Shukeiry.\n\n“Article 19. Zionism is a colonialist movement in its inception, aggressive and expansionist in its goals, racist and segregationist in its configurations and fascist in its means and aims. Israel in its capacity as the spearhead of this destructive movement and the pillar for colonialism is a permanent source of tension and turmoil in the Middle East in particular and to the international community in general. Because of this the People of Palestine are worthy of the support and sustenance of the community of nations.” source\n\n\nRelevant Deals\n\nBalfour Declaration\nMcMahon-Hussein correspondence.\nSykes-Picot agreement\nThe League of Nations Mandate System\n\n\nThere was never a clear expectation on either the British nor Arab side that Palestine would be 100% dedicated with borders to a single Arab Palestinian state.\nJewish Purchasing of land was legal at all stages.\nMultiple binational agreements/concepts rejected by the Arabs until finally the Peel Commission.\nWas 1948 a top-down, pre-planned ethnic cleansing of the Arab population within the newly formed Israeli borders?\n\n\nWhile Israel might have been initially hungry for extra territory, the Arab states constantly gave Israel an excuse to take territory from them. The 1939 White Paper by British would have guaranteed a Palestinian state in 10 years, but Husseini and the AHC rejected it. In 1947, Israel accepted the UN Partition plan while the Arabs refused and instead invaded in 1948. In 1949 (The Lausanne Conference), Israel agreed to accept 100,000 refugees or annex the Gaza Strip in exchange for peace and recognition of its borders, yet the Arabs refused. In 1956, Egypt’s closures of the Straits of Tiran gave Israel legitimate casus belli. In 1967, despite repeated requests from Israel not to attack, Jordan attacked anyway along with Egypt and Syria, losing the West Bank in the process. Israel was willing to return the Golan Heights in 1967 to Syria in exchange for peace. When Israel attempted to reach a final agreement on the Palestinian problem in 2000, and again in 2008, Arafat and Abbas refused.\n\nWhy is this important?\n2. Factual Disagreement - It is incorrect to say that Israel was acting territorially greedy against passive states, and that the Arab states around them were not engaged in a healthy amount of provocation on their own.\n3. Moral Significance - It is important to recognize that, especially in 1948, every state in the region was hungry for land, and the push for territorial conquest was not one-sided. It’s also important to recognize that, while Israel ultimately succeeded in conquering additional land, there were multiple opportunities for Arabs to push for peace in ways that would have forced Israel to agree. Peace between Israel and the Arab states didn’t come until much, much later because everyone in the region assumed that additional fighting would lead to additional territorial gains, but this only proved to be true for Israel.\nQuotes from Israel leaders cautioning territorial expansion pre-1967.\n\n“David Ben-Gurion was still powerfully drawn to Judea and Samaria by his historical-ideological and strategic considerations, but international diplomatic considerations dictated caution and restraint. Besides, the Jordanians had made it abundantly clear that they were out of the fight, and the Israelis still feared British military intervention should hostilities with Jordan be renewed. Zvi Ayalon, the Central Front OC, assured Ben-Gurion that it would take only “5 days” to conquer the West Bank or large parts of it. But Israel’s representatives at the General Assembly meeting in Paris, Abba Eban and Reuven Shiloah, weighed in firmly against.” (1948, Benny Morris, pages 350-351)\n\n\nQuotes of Arabs/Palestinians Rejecting Peace\n\nAbba Eban quipped in 1973 “The Arabs [or the Palestinians] never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity.”\nIn regards to Husseini rejecting the 1939 White Paper, Philip Mattar wrote that the mufti’s decision “clearly indicated that he was putting personal considerations and his idealism above practical politics.”\n\n\nExamples of Palestinian aggression disrupting ongoing peace processes\n\nMarch 27th, 2002, the Passover massacre occurs the day before the announcement of the Arab Peace Initiative.\n\nSuicide bomber killed 30, injured 140.\n\n\nThe 2010 Palestinian militancy campaign, to derail peace talks between Netanyahu and Abbas.\n\nRandom attacks ended with 5 killed, and 5 injured.\n\n\n\n\nThe lead-up and causes for the Six Day War.\n\n\nThe mythologies, loaded languages and international virtue signaling of both sides severely hamper any ability for either people to make progress in this conflict. The victory of Israel in the 1967 war drove their expectations for territorial acquisition to unrealistic heights, causing them to underestimate their Arab neighbors for a crushing psychological defeat in 1973. Similar myths exist on the Palestinian side, where surrounding Arab neighbors drove their expectations for land to unrealistic height, then the international community through UN Resolutions and international declarations made them believe they would acquire a state within the 1967 borders if they simply held out long enough. Constant claims of “apartheid”, “concentration camp conditions” and “genocide” have left the Palestinians believing someone in the international community is going to come along and save them from their predicament.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nFactual Disagreement - The legal status of every single part of this conflict is incredibly hairy, with no clear answers on any side.\nMoral Significance - By constantly claiming that Israel is committing apartheid, or genocide, or forcing Palestinians to live in concentration camps, the international community is making it seem as though the conditions the Palestinians live in are so dire that someone externally is going to swoop in and save them. This will not happen, the Palestinians need to unite around a coherent leadership structure so they can negotiate with Israel and save themselves.\n\n\nInternational criticisms of Israel is highly disproportionate compared to its population and number of people of affected.\n\nHRW\nAmnesty International\nUN Resolutions\n\n\n“Anti-Semitism”\n\nThis has rightfully been called out by Rabani and Finkelstein as a way to shut down all criticism of Israel and to create an environment where all criticisms can be hand-waved as simply anti-Semitic. This shuts down conservation and makes it impossible to facilitate progress.\n\n\n“Ethnic Cleansing”\n\nThis isn’t even a formally defined crime or thing in international law.\nCivilian populations move around and retreat during war, but this term never seems to be used for any other conflict besides the Bosnian War and Israel-Palestine.\n\nExamples:\n\nUkrainians fleeing during Russia’s invasion.\nIn 1923, 1.6 million people were exchanged between Greece and Turkey\nIn 1944-1950, 12-14.6 million Germans expelled from Europe after WWII\nIn 1947 10-20 million people were displaced and 1 million died in the Partition of India.\nJews being expelled from the West Bank in 1948.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Open Air Prison” or “Concentration Camps”\n\nDefinitions\n\nThere is no definition for either of these things.\n\n\nHamas Administration\n\nAccording to Israel and Palestinian sources, Hamas spends over 150m/year on their military budget, including 40m/year just on building tunnels.\nHamas leadership are worth billions while living abroad in Qatar.\n\n\nLiving conditions\n\nThe living conditions are clearly better in the Gaza Strip than in any concentration camp, and are in fact competitive with most Middle Eastern countries.\n\nInfant Mortality in x deaths/1,000 births\n\nRank 26 | Yemen | 45.5\nRank 81 | Iraq | 19.2\nRank 85 | Morocco | 18.7\nRank 88 | Egypt | 17.3\nRank 91 | Gaza | 16\nRank 92 | Syria | 15.5\nRank 106 | Jordan |13.6\nRank 158| Lebanon | 6.9\n\n\nLife Expectancy  in years\n11.

Eiland’s view, he said, was prefaced on the assumption that demographic and other considerations make the prospect for a two-state solution between the Jordan and the Mediterranean unviable.  Currently, he said, there are 11 million people in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza Strip, and that number will increase to 36 million in 50 years.  The area between Beer Sheva and the northern tip of Israel (including the West Bank and Gaza) has the highest population density in the world. Gaza alone, he said, is already “a huge concentration camp” with 1.3 million Palestinians.  Moreover, the land is surrounded on three sides by deserts.  Palestinians need more land and Israel can ill-afford to cede it.  The solution, he argued, lies in the Sinai desert.” - Giora Eiland from a Israeli Debrief relating to the Unilateral Disengagement Plans\n\nThis quote is from 2004 and is not an analysis of the living conditions of those in the Gaza Strip.\n\n\n“The Gaza Strip today is a concentration camp, but not like Bergen-Belsen. The differences are clear and known. This writer is opposed to parallels lacking information, knowledge and understanding, drawn for purposes of provocation, but is also opposed to creating hierarchies of suffering, which, whether concealed or openly, justify any suffering that does not reach the “climax” (which we, the Jews, define). The use here of the term “concentration camp” is based on the need to break free of the linguistic bonds of the Nazi period.” - Amira Hass wrote in Haaretz.\n\nThis quote, of which Finkelstein omits the last sentence of, seems to stand in opposition to his utilization of this to prove the horrendous living conditions of the people in Gaza. Amira’s goal is to broaden the concept of what a concentration camp is, while Norm is attempting to use it in a very narrow way to describe Gaza.\n\n\n“Various versions of this idea became very popular among Israeli Jews and the construction of the fence began at the initiative of the former Minister of Defense, Benjamin Ben Eliezer, more or less along the pre-1967 lines. In fact, the fence around the Gaza Strip was completed a long time ago and the Strip has become the largest concentration camp ever to exist.” Baruch Kimmerling, Politicide: Ariel Sharon’s War Against the Palestinians page 169\n\nThere is zero analysis here, just an opinion offered by the author.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApartheid\n\nDefinitions\n\n“Article 7(2)(h) “The crime of apartheid” means inhumane acts of a character similar to those referred to in paragraph 1, committed in the context of an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime.”\n\n\nProsecutions\n\nNo one has ever been convicted of the crime of apartheid, despite Africa carrying on its apartheid regime for almost 2 decades after the Convention Against Apartheid.\n\nTwo people have been indicted as of 2021 in South Africa.\n\n\n\n\nThere are no laws or policies that treat different races inside Israel differently. Most of the different treatment either comes through immigration policy (which countries have their own right to dictate) or through citizenship status.\n\nThe Nation State Law creates no legal distinctions between citizens and has never been utilized for legislation or policy making.\n\n\nAs applied in the different territories:\n\nThe Gaza Strip: There are no Jews.\nThe West Bank: Law is not applied based on racial domination, it’s applied based on citizenship status.\n\n\nThe Palestinians initially compared themselves to the NLF in Algeria, and now compared themselves to South Africans.\n\n\nGenocide\n\nWas October 7th genocidal? Or any of Hamas’ actions, when they explicitly state that they want to remove or destroy a nation?\nThe ICJ case\n\nThe case only needed to reach the “plausibility” standard, which is incredibly low.\n\n“5. The Court is not asked, in the present phase of the proceedings, to determine whether South Africa’s allegations of genocide are well founded. At this stage, the Court may only examine whether the circumstances of the present case, as they have been presented to the Court, justify the ordering (“indication”) of provisional measures to protect rights under the Genocide Convention which are at risk of being violated before the decision on the merits is rendered. For this examination, the Court need not address many well-known and controversial questions, such as those relating to the right to self-defence and the right of self-determination of peoples, or regarding territorial status. The Court must remain conscious that the Genocide Convention is not designed to regulate armed conflicts as such, even if they are conducted with an excessive use of force and result in mass casualties.” Declaration of Judge Nolte\n“14. The information provided by South Africa regarding Israel’s military operation is not comparable to the evidence before the Court in The Gambia v. Myanmar in 2020. While the Applicant cannot now be expected to provide the Court with detailed reports of an international fact-finding mission, it is not sufficient for South Africa to point to the terrible death and destruction that Israel’s military operation has brought about and is continuing to bring about. The Applicant must be expected to engage not only with the stated purpose of the operation, namely to “destroy Hamas” and to liberate the hostages, but also with other manifest circumstances, such as the calls to the civilian population to evacuate, an official policy and orders to soldiers not to target civilians, the way in which the opposing forces are confronting each other on the ground, as well as the enabling of the delivery of a certain amount of humanitarian aid, all of which may give rise to other plausible inferences from an alleged “pattern of conduct” than genocidal intent. Rather, these measures by Israel, while not conclusive, make it at least plausible that its military operation is not being conducted with genocidal intent. South Africa has not called these underlying circumstances into question and has, in my view, not sufficiently engaged with their implications for the plausibility of the rights of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip deriving from the Genocide Convention.” - Declaration of Judge Nolte\n\n\nIncorrect ICJ Facts\n\nWhy does the ICJ case say the March of Return was ”a large-scale peaceful protest along the separation fence between Gaza and Israel, in which thousands of Palestinians participated every Friday for over 18 months” when the UN says “while the vast majority of protestors have acted in a peaceful manner, during most protests dozens have approached the fence attempting to damage it, burning tires, throwing stones and Molotov cocktails towards Israeli forces and flying incendiary kites and balloons into Israeli territory; the latter resulted in extensive damage to agricultural land and nature reserves inside Israel and risked the lives of Israeli civilians. Some incidents of shooting and throwing of explosive devices have also been reported.\n\nMarch of Return gender violence\n\nPreliminary findings of a survey carried out by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) in the second quarter of 2019 revealed that 38 per cent of women in Gaza reported some form of psychological, physical, sexual, social or economic violence by their husbands, at least once during the preceding 12 months.7\nWhile domestic violence is a longstanding concern in the oPt, the Gender-Based Violence (GBV) Sub-Cluster estimates that the GMR has exacerbated it.[8] Evidence gathered by partners to the working group indicate that mothers have been often blamed by their husbands for the injury or death of their children during a demonstration, and experienced increased related violence. Additionally, widows are at higher risk of immediate psychological and economic violence by family members, as some are expected to re-marry and the family of the late husband often take control over their finances. Further, girls who lost a father, or have a father with a disability, are at increased risk of forced child marriage due to the decreased level of household income, as fathers/husbands are usually the breadwinner of the family.\nYasmin, is a 22-year-old mother living in the north area. “I used to live a happy life, but all changed after my husband was killed in May 2018, during a GMR demonstration. With my two sons I returned to my family’s house and stayed there for a year and a half. As a widow, I was under tighter control by my family.” As is customary, Yasmin was requested to marry her brother-in-law. At first, she refused, but following pressure she accepted. “I didn’t want to go back to my husband’s family home, as they treated me badly. Soon after we married, my new husband began beating me. I never imagined that someone would do that to me. After the killing of my first husband, I started to attend psychosocial support sessions. They helped me feel better, less stressed. However, after I married again, I could no longer attend as my husband’s family opposed that. Now it’s all back again.”\n\n\nParticipants in GMR were likely ruled as combatants.\n\n“If some of the demonstrators can be classified as direct participants in the armed conflict that exists between Israel and the Hamas (this is certainly the case with respect to the terrorists and the armed persons among them; two close categories also includes both members of the terrorist organizations who disguise themselves as demonstrators and also participants in the protest who agree to serve as “human shields” for the terrorists hiding behind them), then the demonstrators lose the protection granted to them pursuant to the principle expressed in Article 51(3) of the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions, which prescribes that the protection afforded to them as civilians shall be removed for such time during which they (actually) take a part in hostilities. In situations such as those, it is highly likely that the three pronged criterion – which was outlined by the team of international experts that the Red Cross convened – would be fulfilled. Upon the fulfillment of the three conditions by the demonstrators, civilians who take part in hostilities lose their protections.

It’s not true this rhetoric about civilians not aware not involved. It’s absolutely not true. … and we will fight until we break their backbone.”449  On 15 October 2023, echoing the words of Prime Minister Netanyahu, the President told foreign media that “we will uproot evil so that there will be good for the entire region and the world.””\n\nFull context, as per their own source: “It is an entire nation out there that is responsible. It’s not true this rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved. It’s absolutely not true.\n“They could have risen up, they could have fought against that evil regime which took over Gaza in a coup ‘d état\n“But we are at war, we are defending our homes, we are protecting our homes, that’s the truth and when a nation protects it’s home it fights and we will fight until we break their back bone.”\nHe acknowledged that many Gazans had nothing to do with Hamas but was adamant that others did.\n“I agree there are many innocent Palestinians who don’t agree with this, but if you have a missile in your goddamn kitchen and you want to shoot it at me, am I allowed to defend myself. We have to defend ourselves, we have the full right to do so.”\nIn Netanyahu’s speech, he says that the IDF will do what it can to minimize civilian casualties and calls upon civilians to flee south.\n\n\n“On 9 October 2023, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant in an Israeli Army ‘situation update’ advised that Israel was “imposing a complete siege on Gaza. No electricity, no food, no water, no fuel. Everything is closed. We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly.”  He also informed troops on the Gaza border that he had “released all the restraints”, stating in terms that: “Gaza won’t return to what it was before. We will eliminate everything. If it doesn’t take one day, it will take a week. It will take weeks or even months, we will reach all places.” He further announced that Israel was moving to “a fullscale response” and that he had “removed every restriction” on Israeli forces.”\n\nHuman Animals\n\n“But I don’t think any Israeli actually understood it that way. “Chayot Adam”, “Human Animals” is a common phrase in modern Hebrew, meaning “people acting in inhuman ways”. An individual, moral condemnation, tied to inhuman acts. Not a racial, pseudo-biological remark. It’s commonly used to describe Israeli criminals of all sorts, from rapists to gangsters. The most famous use of this phrase recently, was a 2019 remark by Oshrat Kotler, a leading Israeli news anchor, as a response to a story about Israeli soldiers beating a bound Palestinian, that the soldiers sent to the West Bank return as “human animals”. This was a very controversial statement, that raised a huge outcry. But even the most outraged right-winger didn’t assume Kotler referred to the entire Israeli people as subhuman.”\n\n\nThe rest of this all refers to expanded military actions, none of this necessarily implies Palestinian people, nor genocidal intent.\n\n\n“Israeli Minister of Finance: On 8 October 2023, Bezalel Smotrich stated at a meeting of the Israeli Cabinet that “[w]e need to deal a blow that hasn’t been seen in 50 years and take down Gaza.””\n\nAs per their own source:  The powerful finance minister, settler leader Bezalel Smotrich, demanded at the cabinet meeting late Saturday that the army “hit Hamas brutally and not take the matter of the captives into significant consideration.” “In war as in war, you have to be brutal,” he was quoted as saying. “We need to deal a blow that hasn’t been seen in 50 years and take down Gaza.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Refugee Camp”\n4.

This information is dated December 2012, a full 3 months before the New York Times article was published, which should have allowed the NYT plenty of time to note Lloyd’s financial and professional conflicts of interest.”\n\n\nPostol’s research also plagiarized pictures and relied on YT videos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational support should be reserved for peaceful Palestinian movements, not violent ones. Historically, Israel has been willing to pursue reasonable attempts at peace made by her neighbors, e.g. Egypt (1979), Jordan (1994), Bahrain (2020), the UAE (2020), Morocco (2020) and Sudan (2021, and attempted to with the Palestinians (1993, 2000, 2008) and Syria (1967, 2000). These peace deals have come at great cost to Israeli leadership (Begin’s fierce resistance from his own party for transferring the Sinai, Rabin’s assassination in 1995 for the Oslo Accords) and to Arab leaders (Egypt was suspended from the Arab League for 10 years and Sadat was later assassinated for being a sell-out to the West). Palestinian leaders seem to prioritize their personal political careers and their consolidation of political support over the interests of the Palestinian people (Arafat for the Oslo Accords, and Camp David/Taba Summit, and Abbas in 2008). The Palestinians need a leader who is willing to risk some political division among the PLO/PA, and the people need to opt towards peace since that is the greatest way to apply optimal international pressure against Israel. A violent adversary has historically always given Israel room for territorial acquisition (1947-1949, 1967, 2000, 2010), while a peaceful adversary has always sparked international pressure for Israel to negotiate.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nFactual Disagreement - Palestinians are not improving their position through violence, yet that has been essentially their preferred arm of negotiating since 1948, with fedayeen attacks, the creation of the PLO, and international terrorist attacks. Violence has caused operations that have severely damaged Palestinian interests, such as Swords of Iron, Protective Edge, Cast Lead, and unilateral disengagement from Gaza. Violence from Palestinians has also consistently caused them to become alienated from their Arab neighbors (Egypt with the Muslim Brotherhood/assassination attempts, Jordan with Abdullah’s assassination in 1951, Black September in 1970, Wasfi-Tal’s assassination in 1971, Lebanon from 1970-1982).\nMoral Significance - Encouraging the Palestinians to act with violence gives Israel an excuse to continue the blockade in Gaza and to refuse Palestinians a state, while supporting Palestinian peace-makers puts pressure on Israel to come to a final settlement of the Palestinian problem while removing their justification for aggressive action. Israel’s greatest fear, historically, has always been an Arab leader pushing for peace. If Arafat had pushed for peace against Israel, the settlements would be so much smaller than they are now. If Sadat hadn’t pushed for peace with Israel, it’s possible they would control the Sinai to this day.\n\n\nNorm’s position on violence:\n\n2015 Reddit AMA\n\n“until and unless they engage in mass nonviolent resistance, such as during the first intifada, it’s hopeless”\n“There’s a huge reservoir of international support now for the Palestinians, while Israel’s stock has plummeted. If Palestinians put forth reasonable demands (based on international law) and engaged in mass nonviolent resistance, Israel would be cornered”\n\n\nOctober 7th, 2023 on Norman’s website\n\nToday they breached the camp’s walls. If we honor John Brown’s armed resistance to slavery; if we honor the Jews who revolted in the Warsaw Ghetto—then moral consistency commands that we honor the heroic resistance in Gaza. I, for one, will never begrudge—on the contrary, it warms every fiber of my soul—the scenes of Gaza’s smiling children as their arrogant Jewish supremacist oppressors have, finally, been humbled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe basis for negotiations is only informed by international law, not defined by it. None of Israel’s major prior bilateral negotiations with any partners (Egypt, Jordan, Bahrain, the UAE, Morocco, Sudan) have been restricted by UN resolutions or international law. These negotiations have only succeeded when both parties were willing to recognize the political, social and military realities on the ground that both sides could reasonably agree to. Harping over and over again on “moral” interpretations of international law is meaningless, as Israel will not realistically begin negotiations in any place that calls for them to return to prior rejected arrangements (1947 partition plan, 2000 Taba Summit).\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nFactual Disagreement - Negotiations historically for Israel have not been restricted to international law or UN Resolutions. Negotiations need to begin with intense consideration for the realities on the ground.\nMoral Significance - Fixating on certain interpretations of international law will continue to drive Palestinian expectations to unrealistic heights. International law is not going to expel 450,000 Israeli’s from the West Bank.\n\n\nThe legality of the settlements\n\n“Recalling the obligation under the Quartet Roadmap, endorsed by its resolution 1515 (2003), for a freeze by Israel of all settlement activity, including “natural growth”, and the dismantlement of all settlement outposts erected since March 2001.” - SC 2334 (2016)\n\n\nResolution 242\n\nNot legally binding, this was passed under Chapter VI of the UN charter.\n\nThe “peaceful resolution” requirement of this was violated by every Arab state in 1973, and was continually violated by the PLO and any other group that engaged in violence against Israel to “end the occupation.”\n\n\nThis shaped the resolutions between Israel and Egypt, Jordan, Oslo I and Oslo II, yet did not lead to the creation of any permanent state of permanent resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n“There was much bickering over whether that resolution should say from “the” territories or from “all” territories. In the French version, which is equally authentic, it says withdrawal de territory, with de meaning “the.” We wanted that to be left a little vague and subject to future negotiation because we thought the Israeli border along the West Bank could be “rationalized”; certain anomalies could easily be straightened out with some exchanges of territory, making a more sensible border for all parties. We also wanted to leave open demilitarization measures in the Sinai and the Golan Heights and take a fresh look at the old city of Jerusalem.” - Dean Rusk, US Secretary of State, As I Saw It, page 389.\n“And it was only when this euphemism was embedded in the language of a UN Security Council Resolution that Israel was ready to endorse it. The constructive ambiguity of the November 1967 Security Council Resolution Number 242, which called for peace based on the restitution of ‘territories’ instead of ‘the territories’, allowed Israel to claim that the borders would have to be modified on all fronts as a condition for peace and gave maneuvering space to her post-war diplomacy. Resolution 242 was the result of the need to find a formula that would reconcile Israel’s unrealistic expectation to have full peace for less than all the territories, and the Arabs’ drive for a full restitution of land in exchange for a watered-down state of non-belligerency.” - Shlomo Ben-Ami, Scars of War, Wounds of Peace page 128\n\n\nWho has the majority support right now in the region?\n\nIsrael\n\nNormalization of relations with Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Sudan, UAE, Bahrain, (Saudi Arabia), formal treaties signed by Egypt.\n\n\nPalestine\n\nRecognition?\n\n\nUSA\n\nPublic still overwhelming supports Israel and their mission to remove Hamas. source\n\n\n\n\nNorm’s references to this.\n\n“If you’re serious about trying to build a mass movement, you can’t go beyond what the public is ready to accept.”\n“If you want to use the law to reach public opinion, you can’t be selective with the law.”\nDoes Norm still support the Houthis?\n\n\n\n\nThe Palestinian refugee problem is being artificially inflated. There are no other groups of refugees on the planet that have the unique treatment right now afforded to the Palestinians, and it only serves to drive a deeper wedge in between Israelis and Palestinians in regards to solving this conflict.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nFactual Disagreement - The Palestinian refugee situation is unacceptable. No other refugee group has this treatment.\nMoral Significance - The artificial treatment of Palestinian refugees keeps prolonging the suffering of both Palestinians in Palestine and outside of it because it makes it more difficult for any final agreement to be reached, while simultaneously preventing Palestinians outside of Palestine from ever being settled into a new home.\n\n\nFacts\n\nUNRWA refusal to resettle.

All available evidence of Israel taking extraordinary steps to warn civilian populations of incoming attacks likely satisfies their obligation to Article 58 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions, while death and casualty numbers in the highly urbanized environment seem to satisfy that Israel is distinguishing between targets (an obligation under API Article 48). On the contrary, Hamas had no good jus ad bellum as their October 7th attack was not preventing or in response to any incoming Israeli attack, and their jus in bello is clearly not justified as they have failed to uphold their obligations (under API Article 58) to protect their civilian population, failed to distinguish between military and civilian targets, and utilized their civilian population in an attempt to shield themselves from Israeli military forces.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nFactual Disagreement - Claims that Israel is conducting themselves in a way that, by policy, disagrees with the LoAC is entirely unsubstantiated, and has been for all of their major Gaza conflicts. Claims that excuses Hamas’ actions, or make them comparable to the Israeli government, are completely absurd.\nMoral Significance - Israel, morally, has a right to defend itself. Drawing false equivalences between Hamas and Israel, especially by incorrectly citing international law and disregarding the laws of armed conflict, undermines the validity of international law and endangers the safety of all civilians in future armed conflict. It is also essential to recognize that Israel, a Democratic country that is sensitive to the whims of its voters and to international pressure, has made much more information available from its archive than the parties they face. Their reluctance to participate in certain international investigations is understandable.\n\n\nInternational humanitarian law and the law of armed conflict.\n\nIHL seeks to balance two key goals – military necessity and humanity. In this way, the law protects civilians from the ravages of war while still enabling effec- tive military operations. Interpretations of the law that leave militaries with no lawful means by which to engage in necessary operations are often viewed as counter-productive and pose the risk of generating disregard for legal norms. The Goldstone Report unfortunately fails to give sufficient weight to this inherent bal- ancing – the most basic and historic premise of humanitarian law: the ‘desire to diminish the evils of war, as far as military requirements permit’. -  Laurie R. Blank, “&gt; THE APPLICATION OF IHL IN THE GOLDSTONE REPORT: A CRITICAL COMMENTARY\n\n\nLack of accountability\n\n“The Gaza Strip falls under the jurisdiction of the PA according to the Oslo Accords (pursuant to which the PA was established). However, in June 2007, after armed confrontations with PA forces, Hamas established a de facto administration in Gaza and has since controlled internal affairs there, including the administration of justice. The Hamas de facto administration has neither prosecuted nor shown any intention to prosecute members of its armed wing or members of other armed groups responsible for firing rockets into southern Israel. On the contrary, during periods when they are not committed to a ceasefire with Israel, Hamas leaders promote such unlawful attacks.” - Amensty International 2009, OPERATION ‘CAST LEAD’: 22 DAYS OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION\n\n\nJus ad bellum\n\nIsrael\n\nSelf-defense, destruction of Hamas, fully justified.\n\n\nHamas\n\nThey have no cause for war. Occupation is not a cause for war.\n\n\n\n\nJus in bello\n\nPrinciple of distinction\n\nThe Principle of Distinction between Civilians and Combatants\n\nRule 1 of IHL, The Principle of Distinction between Civilians and Combatants\nThe parties to the conflict must at all times distinguish between civilians and combatants. Attacks may only be directed against combatants. Attacks must not be directed against civilians.\n\n\nViolations\n\n“Mortars and so-called Qassam rockets, which are locally made in Gaza, and longer range Grad-type rockets smuggled into Gaza via the tunnels from Egypt, are unguided projectiles which cannot be directed at specific targets. Attacks using such rockets are indiscriminate and hence unlawful under international law.” - Amensty International 2009, OPERATION ‘CAST LEAD’: 22 DAYS OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION\n“Between 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009 the armed wing of Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups based in Gaza launched rockets and mortars 109 on a daily basis into towns and villages in southern Israel, as well as against Israeli military positions and patrols inside Gaza and along Gaza’s perimeter.” - Amensty International 2009, OPERATION ‘CAST LEAD’: 22 DAYS OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION\n“In other words, these weapons cannot be accurately aimed in a manner that distinguishes between military objectives and civilian objects, as required by international humanitarian law. Hence, when these weapons were used with the intent of striking military targets in Israel, but struck civilian objects instead, they constituted indiscriminate attacks. When rocket attacks were intended to strike homes, civilian infrastructure or civilians, they were direct attacks on civilians or civilian objects. In either case, such attacks constitute serious violations of international humanitarian law and are war crimes (see Chapter 5).“ - Amensty International 2009, OPERATION ‘CAST LEAD’: 22 DAYS OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION\n“On at least one occasion a Palestinian rocket which fell short of its target landed inside Gaza and caused damage to a World Food Programme (WPF) warehouse near the Karni merchandise crossing between Israel and Gaza (the crossing has been closed since 2007). The warehouse is usually guarded by Israeli forces and since the beginning of Operation “Cast Lead” no UN staff members had been present there. The rocket strike caused no casualties but it damaged the warehouse, which at the time contained 400 tons of food and non-food items. The UN Board of Inquiry found that the damage to the warehouse was caused by a Qassam-type rocket locally manufactured in Gaza.” - Amensty International 2009, OPERATION ‘CAST LEAD’: 22 DAYS OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION\n“In response, the groups have argued that they have no other weapons, nor any way of obtaining precision weapons like those used by the Israeli army. They also say that they are acting in response to Israeli attacks which have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians for each Israeli killed by rockets. Some have argued that the attacks are aimed at Israeli military bases or positions in and around towns and villages in southern Israel and that the Israeli villages around Gaza are mostly military bases. While some of the rockets might strike military targets, which the groups would consider strategically more valuable, the argument is invalidated both by the obviously indiscriminate nature of the attacks and by the fact that whenever the rockets strike people these are invariably civilians. Other spokespeople have argued that the rockets are rarely lethal and that their main aim is to “disturb” life in Israel so long as Israel does not allow Palestinians to have a normal life. All these arguments are inadmissible under international humanitarian law. Whether or not attacks actually result in civilian casualties, they are in violation of international law, which also prohibits attacks aimed at spreading terror among the civilian population. The patterns of attacks and statements by members and leaders of Palestinian groups also indicate that they have no qualms about launching attacks against civilians and that they in fact carry out such attacks intending to kill and injure Israeli civilians. Such attacks constitute war crimes.” - Amensty International 2009, OPERATION ‘CAST LEAD’: 22 DAYS OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION\n“The organization has stated that the campaign of suicide bombings and other attacks against civilians by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups amounted to crimes against humanity.” - Amensty International 2009, OPERATION ‘CAST LEAD’: 22 DAYS OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION\n\n\n\n\nPrinciple of proportionality\n\nPrinciple of Proportionality in Attack\n\nRule 14 of IHL, Launching an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated, is prohibited.\nThis principle is codified in Article 51(5)(b) of AP I, and repeated in Article 57.\nUnder the statue of the ICC, “intentionally launching an attack in the knowledge that such attack will cause incidental loss of life or injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects … which would be clearly excessive in relation to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated”\n\nThe overall military advantage anticipated is important.\n\n\n\n\nViolations\n\nEvery single attack into Israel fails the proportionality check. The rocket attacks are indiscriminate and are rarely aimed at military installations or positions.\n\n\n\n\nPrinciple of precaution\n\nPrinciple of Precautions in Attack\n\nRule 15 of IHL, In the conduct of military operations, constant care must be taken to spare the civilian population, civilians and civilian objects. All feasible precautions must be taken to avoid, and in any event to minimize, incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects.\n\n\nViolations\n\nEvery single Hamas attack is a violation of this rule. Hamas does not ever take time to warn the Israeli civilian population in any way before engaging in attacks\n\n\n\n\nHuman Shields\n\nRule 97, The Use of Human Shields is prohibited.\n\nThe prohibition of using human shields in the Geneva Conventions, Additional Protocol I and the Statute of the International Criminal Court are couched in terms of using the presence (or movements) of civilians or other protected persons to render certain points or areas (or military forces) immune from military operations.\nIt can be concluded that the use of human shields requires an intentional co-location of military objectives and civilians or persons hors de combat with the specific intent of trying to prevent the targeting of those military objectives.\n\n\nArticle 58 of AP I also precautions against the effects of attack.\n1. The Parties to the conflict shall, to the maximum extent feasible:\n1. without prejudice to Article 49 of the Fourth Convention, endeavour to remove the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control from the vicinity of military objectives;\n2. avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas;\n3. take the other necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations.\nViolations\n\nHamas and other Palestinian armed groups also violated international humanitarian law in their conduct within Gaza. They launched rockets and located military equipment and Amnesty International July 2009 Israel/Gaza: Operation ‘Cast Lead’: 22 days of death and destruction positions near civilian homes, endangering the lives of the inhabitants by exposing them to the risk of Israeli attacks. They also used empty homes and properties as combat positions during armed confrontations with Israeli forces, exposing the inhabitants of nearby houses to the danger of attacks or of being caught in the crossfire.” - Amensty International 2009, OPERATION ‘CAST LEAD’: 22 DAYS OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION\n”Between 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009 the armed wing of Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups based in Gaza launched rockets and mortars 109 on a daily basis into towns and villages in southern Israel, as well as against Israeli military positions and patrols inside Gaza and along Gaza’s perimeter.“ - Amensty International 2009, OPERATION ‘CAST LEAD’: 22 DAYS OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION\n“Hamas and other armed groups also endangered Palestinian civilians by failing to take all feasible precautions in the conduct of their military activities, notably by firing rockets from residential areas and storing weapons, explosives and ammunition in them. They also mixed with the civilian population, although this would be difficult to avoid in the small and overcrowded Gaza Strip, and there is no evidence that they did so with the intent of shielding themselves. The extremely high population density in Gaza, a small territory and one of the most densely populated places in the world, entails additional challenges for all the parties involved in conflict or armed confrontations. Notwithstanding these difficulties, Hamas and other armed groups have an obligation to avoid conduct which, by intent or through recklessness, exposes the civilian population to danger, and have an obligation not to use the civilian population as a cover for their military activities. Intentionally using civilians to shield a military objective – often referred to as using “human shields” – is a war crime” - Amensty International 2009, OPERATION ‘CAST LEAD’: 22 DAYS OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION\n“Hamas and other Palestinian groups endangered civilians by firing rockets from populated residential neighbourhoods.” - Amensty International 2009, OPERATION ‘CAST LEAD’: 22 DAYS OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION\n“In another area of Gaza City, a resident showed Amnesty International delegates a place from where a rocket had been launched: a small patch of empty land some 50m from residential houses. Television footage from the Arabic TV station al-Arabiya broadcast during Operation “Cast Lead” also showed a presenter, seemingly caught off guard, saying that she had just heard a rocket being fired from the street near the building which houses the TV station, in the centre of Gaza City.” - Amensty International 2009, OPERATION ‘CAST LEAD’: 22 DAYS OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION\n“Hamas and other groups generally store weapons in civilian areas and there is no reason to believe that it was any different during Operation “Cast Lead”. By doing so, it rendered such locations possible targets of attack and therefore exposed civilians who may have been present to risk.” - Amensty International 2009, OPERATION ‘CAST LEAD’: 22 DAYS OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION\n“The groups openly acknowledge that their fighters and military facilities are present in towns and villages in Gaza, but argue that their role is to defend their communities against Israeli attacks and invasions.“ - Amensty International 2009, OPERATION ‘CAST LEAD’: 22 DAYS OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION\n“Some of the armed groups deny having fired rockets from populated areas or having stored them there, while others argue that they were merely defending their communities and that Israeli forces targeted civilians not involved in military activities and locations from which no attacks had been launched.” - Amensty International 2009, OPERATION ‘CAST LEAD’: 22 DAYS OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION\n“The placing of combatants and a variety of weapons within towns and villages by Hamas and Israel, while not in itself of evidence of using “human shields”, does amount to a violation of their obligation to take the necessary precautions to protect civilians under its control from the dangers of military operations “to the maximum extent feasible”, and in particular “avoiding locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas”.” - Amensty International 2009, OPERATION ‘CAST LEAD’: 22 DAYS OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION\n\n\n\n\nDestroying civilian infrastructure\n\nApplicable international law\nDestroying civilian infrastructure is not a war crime.\n\n\n\n\nComparisons to other conflicts\n\nThe Nat Turner comparison completely fails.\n\nThe Palestinians in the Gaza strip are not in any ways chattel slavery like African slaves imported to the United States. The conditions are not even remotely comparable and it is grossly downplaying the institution of slavery in the United States to pretend.\nThe Nat Turner rebellion was composed of slaves who fought with knives, hatchets and fence posts. Hamas receive international aid from all over the world, taxes from smuggled goods, military training from Iran, financing from Qatar, and smuggle weapons and components for rockets into their territory, all to the detriment of the people they are supposed to be administering to.\n\n\nThe Warsaw Ghetto uprising quite literally would have been justified in every sense of the word.\n\nThe Jews were fighting against SS Soldiers that were coming to the ghetto to take them to a concentration camp where Jewish people were already being exterminated.\nThe Jews were not an organized army receiving funding and training from countries and militaries around the world - on the contrary, their plight was being completely ignored.\nThe Jews were not targeting civilians, they were fighting against soldiers coming into deport them to Treblinka and Majdanek.\n\n\n\n\nThe Blockade\n\nImpacts to Palestinians colemanhughes.substack.com/p/what-are-conditions-in-gaza-like\nAnd Finkelstein’s apologia for the 10/7 Hamas fighters––who were presumably in their late teens and 20s––is that they were “born into a concentration camp” and have known nothing else–– which suggests that Gaza has been a concentration camp for almost two decades.\n\n\nContemporary issues undermining the International Community position\n\nAl-Shifa hospital stuff\n\nHow much warning did Israel give before attacking the hospital?\nUNRWA\nHospital staff in al-Shifa\nWorkers affiliated with Hamas\nHuge tunnel near UNRWA building/area\nTunnels\nMunition stores\n\n\n\n\nList conditions for peace/objectives on both sides, Israel vs Hamas.\n\nAdministrative Detention of Palestinian\n\n\nWhen Israel leaves things get bad - Gaza Strip 2005, West Bank/Second Intifada (2000-2005), Lebanon (Hezbollah)\nCeasefires broken by both sides\n\n\n"},"Debate-Prep/2024.02.28---Finkelstein-and-Rabbani/Norman-Finkelstein":{"title":"Norman Finkelstein","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Debate\nwww.youtube.com/live/Zzjicdi3O0o\nClaims\n\nGaza has been illegally annexed by Israel according to international law.\n\nhas it been?

While these were often spoken about in conjunction with one another, they were understood to mean different things.\n\n“Insurrection against a government may or may not culminate in an organized rebellion, but a civil war always begins by insurrection against the lawful authority of the Government. A civil war is never solemnly declared; it becomes such by its accidents — the number, power, and organization of the persons who originate and carry it on. When the party in rebellion occupy and hold in a hostile manner a certain portion of territory, have declared their independence, have cast off their allegiance, have organized armies, have commenced hostilities against their former sovereign, the world acknowledges them as belligerents, and the contest a war.” - Supreme Court in the 1862 Prize Cases decision, written by Mr. Justice Grier.\n\n\nExamples of widely regarded insurrections before the Civil War:\n\nShay’s Rebellion\nThe Whiskey Insurrection\nThe Burr Insurrection\nJohn Brown’s raid\n\n\nExamples of prior insurrections:\n\n1794, when Pennsylvania farmers burnt the house of a tax collector\n1799, when John Fries and friends made a show of arms that resulted in the release of persons charged with federal tax evasion\n1847, when Hispanic and Native Americans attacked occupying American officials in New Mexico\n1851, when Pennsylvanians obstructed official efforts to capture an alleged fugitive slave\n1856, when rival forces were violently resisting laws on slavery\n\n\n\nJanuary 6th, 2021\n\n\nThere was an assemblage.\n\nHundreds of people breached the Capitol Building and thousands trespassed on federal land.\n\n\n\nThere was clear resistance to federal law.\n\nThe trespassers intended to disrupt the proceedings mandated by the Electoral Count Act.\nAnderson v.

Justice Robert Grier charged the grand jury in United States v. Hanway that a defendant who was not leagued with violent resisters to federal law could not be prosecuted for treason.\n“Grier insisted that spontaneous riots were not insurrections, that insurrections required a commitment to use force to resist law, not spur of the moment violence.”\n\n\n\nFinal Argument:\n\n“The Colorado Court found that Donald Trump acted as part of an assemblage that he helped bring into being; that Trump was resisting the enforcement of federal and constitutional rules, that Trump took numerous illegal actions to prevent the peaceful transition of presidential power; that Trump engaged in an ongoing course of conduct aimed at producing violent resistance to the peaceful transfer of presidential power; that Trump was attempting to incite his supporters to attack Congress; and that Trump’s speech occurred sufficiently close in time and place to when and where the insurrection took place to be considered an incitement.”\n\nCurrent Understanding: An insurrection is a violent (or threat of violence) “event” where the goal is to significantly subvert  some essential form of government exercise of control."},"Debate-Review/2024.06.29---Dave-Smith-vs-Vaush-on-the-Ukraine-Russia-War":{"title":"2024.06.29 - Dave Smith vs Vaush on the Ukraine-Russia War","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Breaking Points - Dave Smith VS Vaush HEATED DEBATE On Ukraine, NATO, Nuclear War\nOpening statements\n\nVaush\n\nThinks we should either fully fund Ukraine or not at all, seems to be in favor of defending Ukraine because allowing Russia to invade a neighbor would be destabilizing.

They were useful, in that out of their mistakes may be gathered experience for carrying them out successfully on a larger scale. They have, of course, done harm also.

The Jews will leave as honored friends, and if some of them return, they will receive the same favorable welcome and treatment at the hands of civilized nations as is accorded to all foreign visitors. Their exodus will have no resemblance to a flight, for it will be a well-regulated expedition under control of public opinion.

Here two territories come under consideration, Palestine and Argentina. In both countries important experiments in colonization have been made, though on the mistaken principle of a gradual infiltration of Jews. An infiltration is bound to end in disaster. It continues till the inevitable moment when the native population feels itself threatened, and forces the Government to stop the further influx of Jews. Immigration is consequently futile unless based on an assured supremacy. The Society of Jews will treat with the present masters of the land, putting itself under the protectorate of the European Powers, if they prove friendly to the plan. We could offer the present possessors of the land enormous advantages; take upon ourselves part of the public debt, build new roads for traffic, which our presence in the country would render necessary, etc. The creation of our State would be beneficial to adjacent countries, because the cultivation of a strip of land increases the value of its surrounding districts in innumerable ways.\nHighlight(pink) - Page 28 · Location 442\nPALESTINE OR ARGENTINA? Shall we choose Palestine or Argentina?[ 2] We shall take what is given us, and what is selected by Jewish public opinion. The Society will settle both these points. Argentina is one of the most fertile countries in the world, extends over a vast area, has a sparse population and a mild climate. The Argentine Republic would derive considerable profit from the cession of a portion of its territory to us. The present infiltration of Jews has certainly produced some friction, and it would be necessary to enlighten the Republic on the intrinsic difference of our new movement. Palestine is our ever-memorable historic home. The very name of Palestine would attract our people with a force of marvellous potency. Supposing His Majesty the Sultan were to give us Palestine, we could in return pledge ourselves to regulate the whole finances of Turkey. We should there form a portion of the rampart of Europe against Asia, an outpost of civilization as opposed to barbarism. The sanctuaries of Christendom would be safeguarded by assigning to them an extra-territorial status, such as is well known to the law of nations. We should form a guard of honor about these sanctuaries, answering for the fulfilment of this duty with our existence. This guard of honor would be the great symbol of the solution of the Jewish Question after eighteen centuries of Jewish suffering.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 29 · Location 462\nNow experts are often nothing more than men sunk into the groove of daily routine, whence they have an extraordinarily limited view.

And we ourselves have become so depressed and discouraged by our historic sufferings that, parrot-like, we repeat and believe these mistakes. Such a one is the assertion that our love of business is extreme. Now it is well known that wherever we are permitted to take part in the uprising of classes, we give up our business as soon as possible. The great majority of Jewish business men give their sons a superior education. Hence, indeed, the so-called “Judaising” of good professions. But even in economically feebler grades of society, our love of trade is not so predominant as is generally supposed. In the Eastern countries of Europe there are great numbers of Jews who are not traders, and who are not afraid of hard work either. The Society of Jews will be in a position to prepare scientifically accurate statistics of our human forces. The new duties and prospects which the new country offers to our people will satisfy our present handicraftsmen, and will transform many present small traders into manual workers.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 84 · Location 1367\nOne of the great committees which the Society will have to appoint will be the council of jurists of the State. These must formulate the best, that is, the best modern constitution possible. I believe that a good constitution should be of moderately elastic nature. In another work I have explained in detail what forms of government I hold to be the best. I think a democratic monarchy and an aristocratic republic are the two most superior forms of a State, because in them the form of State and the principle of government are opposed to one another, and thus preserve a true balance of power. I am a staunch supporter of monarchical institutions, because these allow of a consistent policy, and represent the interests of a historically famous family born and educated to rule, whose desires are bound up with the preservation of the State. But our history has been too long interrupted for us to attempt direct continuity of ancient constitutional forms without exposing ourselves to the charge of absurdity.\nHighlight(pink) - Page 85 · Location 1376\nA democracy without a sovereign’s useful counterpoise is extreme in appreciation and condemnation, tends to idle discussion in Parliaments, and produces that objectionable class of men, professional politicians. Nations are also really not fit for unlimited democracy at present, and will become less and less fitted for it in the future. For a pure democracy presupposed a predominance of simple customs, and our customs become daily more complex with the growth of commerce and increase of culture. “Le ressort d’une démocratic est la vertu,” said wise Montesquieu. And where is this virtue, that is to say, this political virtue, to be met with? I do not believe in our political virtue; firstly, because we are no better than the rest of modern humanity; and, secondly, because freedom will make us show our fighting qualities at first. I also hold a settling of questions by the public voice to be a foolish proceeding, because there are no simple political questions which can be settled by Ayes and Noes. The masses are also more prone even than Parliaments to be led away by heterodox opinions, and to be swayed by vigorous ranting. It is impossible to formulate a wise internal or external policy in a popular assembly.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 86 · Location 1398\nIt might be suggested that our want of a common current language would present difficulties. We cannot converse with one another in Hebrew. Who amongst us has a sufficient acquaintance with Hebrew to ask for a railway-ticket in that language? Such a thing cannot be done.[ 2] Yet the difficulty is very easily circumvented. Every man can preserve the language in which his thoughts are at home. Switzerland affords a conclusive proof of the possibility of a federation of tongues. We shall remain in the new country what we now are here, and we shall never cease to cherish the memory of the native land out of which we have been driven.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 87 · Location 1410\nShall we end by having a theocracy? No indeed. Faith unites us, knowledge gives us freedom. We shall therefore prevent any theocratic tendencies from coming to the fore on the part of our priesthood. We shall keep our priests within the confines of their temples in the same way as we shall keep our volunteer forces within the confines of their barracks. Army and priesthood shall receive honors as high as their valuable functions deserve. But they must not interfere in the administration of the State which confers distinction upon them, else they will conjure up difficulties without and within. Every man will be as free and undisturbed in his faith or his disbelief as he is in his nationality. And if it should occur that men of different creeds and different nationalities came to live amongst us, we should accord them honorable protection, and equality before the law. We learnt toleration in Europe. This is not sarcastically said ; for the Anti-Semitism of today could in very few places be taken for old religious intolerance. It is for the most part a movement among civilized nations by which they try to chase away the spectres of their own past.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 93 · Location 1521\n\nThe author changed this view when the feasibility of Hebrew as a living language was demonstrated to him.\n"},"Research/Book-Notes/Culture-and-Conflict-in-the-Middle-East":{"title":"Culture and Conflict in the Middle East","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Notebook Export\nCulture and Conflict in the Middle East\nSalzman, Philip Carl\nCitation (APA): Salzman, P.

Retrieved from Amazon.com\n\nAnnotations\nHighlight(orange) - Location 35\nThis is how balanced opposition in the Middle East works: Everybody is a member of a nested set of kin groups, from very small to very large. These groups are vested with responsibility for the defense of each and every one of its members and responsibility for the harm each and every one of its members do to outsiders. This is called by anthropologists “collective responsibility,” and the actions taken by a group on its own behalf are called “self-help.” If there is a confrontation, small groups face opposing small groups, middle-sized groups face opposing middle-sized groups, or large groups face opposing large groups: family vs. family, lineage vs. lineage, clan vs. clan, tribe vs. tribe, confederacy vs. confederacy, sect vs. sect, the Islamic community (umma) vs. the infidels. This is where the deterrence lies, in the balance between opponents; individuals do not face groups, and small groups do not face large groups. Any potential aggressor knows that his target is not solitary or meager, but is always, in principle, a formidable formation much the same size as his.\nHighlight(orange) - Location 49\nBalanced opposition works to the extent that it does because individual members of groups come to the aid of their fellow group members, even at serious risk of injury or loss of life, or with serious material cost. Why do they do this? For two main reasons: one pragmatic, the other cultural. The pragmatic reason is the strong belief that the only ones who can be counted on for help are members of one’s kinship group. You act to support your fellow members, on the understanding that they will come to your aid when you are in need. This is what anthropologists call “generalized reciprocity,” in which you act now to support group members, in the expectation that, some time later, when needed, they will support you. This is sensible self-interest. The cultural reason is that your honor depends upon your living up to your commitments, in this case as a member of the group. If you are not willing to set aside your short-term personal interest, your comfort, and safety to come to the aid of your fellow members, you lose your honor and standing, earn a bad reputation, are not respected by others, and are avoided as a partner in any enterprise.\nHighlight(orange) - Location 70\nThe postcolonial argument set forth in Edward Said’s groundbreaking Orientalism (1978), that people are really more or less the same, and that any distinctions between cultures tures impose a false essentialism aimed at defining certain populations as “other” primarily to demean them and justify imperial and colonial oppression, rashly dismissed culture as of nugatory significance. The assumption that all people are just like “us” is a kind of ethnocentrism that projects our values, our ways of thinking, and our goals onto other peoples. The anthropological study of culture around the world is based on a recognition of cultural differences, on an appreciation tion of the importance of culture in people’s lives, and on respect for other people’s cultures.\nHighlight(orange) - Location 90\nThus adherence to balanced opposition results in individual and group independence, freedom, responsibility, equality, bellicosity, licosity, and courage. At the same time, however, balanced opposition sition is a frame that limits alternatives, some of which might have proven useful. Balanced opposition emphasizes particular loyalties: my lineage against the other lineage; my tribal section against the other tribal section; my tribe against the other tribe; Muslims against infidels. This particularism of loyalties is not consistent with a universalistic normative frame, for example, a constitution of rules which is inclusive, applying equally to everyone. Balanced opposition is rule by group loyalty, rather than rule by rules. Factionalism is the norm; there is a constant fission into smaller groups in opposition to one another, and fusion into larger groups opposed to one another. This structural tural contingency too is inconsistent with constitutional rule in which rules apply to all and are upheld by all at all times. Particularism ticularism and contingency, so basic to complementary opposition, tion, preclude universalistic constitutional frameworks and thus inhibit social and political integration at broader territorial levels including larger and diverse populations.\nHighlight(orange) - Location 213\nLet us take one more illustration from the heart of Arabia. The Rwala Bedouin in northern Arabia have traditionally specialized cialized in raising camels (Lancaster 1997). This seems natural to the observer; the Rwala live in the desert and the camel is the best desert livestock. But why raise camels, and why live in the desert? The answer, or at least part of the answer, is that for millennia there has been a strong market demand in the Middle East for camels. Camels have traditionally brought a good price and allowed those who raised them a good living. The reason is that camels were required for the caravan trade, which was such a major part of the Middle Eastern economy. Merchants and traders always required a good supply of camels for their caravans. The solitary Bedouin wandering with his camels in the distant desert wastes, seemingly so disconnected nected with swarming cities and crass commerce, had in mind the urban livestock market, which was the destination of many of his animals.\nHighlight(orange) - Location 236\nEach tribesman is part of a series of nested patrilineages, the smallest defined by close ancestors, and the larger defined by more-distant ancestors. Each lineage at every level has the responsibility to assist and defend each member. Lineages also collectively hold important economic resources, such as pasture ture and water. There is thus an institutionalized mutual dependence among all members. As a result, social solidarity and cohesion, asabiyya, is commonly found amongst tribesmen.\nHighlight(orange) - Location 281\nWhat is evident from considering the resources held collectively tively by tribesmen is that the tribe is much more than the collected lected families of the members. Families are sometimes referred to, by social scientists, as the “basic units” of society, but this characterization is, in important ways, misleading. Families can pursue their activities and goals because they do so within a larger social framework that, in the case of tribal nomads, is defined by the constitution of the tribe. In the Middle East, it is the tribe that provides access to many necessary sary material resources and guarantees security for its members. bers. It is the tribal descent system that defines relationships among individuals and groups. Without the tribal framework, life would be a war of all against all.\nHighlight(orange) - Location 360\nIntensive production in rich environments draws state control trol and extraction of taxes and services. Extensive production in remote, marginal environments can escape state control and draw lovers of independence. For this reason, how people pursue making a living depends partly on the amount and weight of state intrusion. If state oppression becomes too heavy, some peasants may give up everything and escape to the margins, taking up pastoralism if they can. Or if state control breaks down altogether, and peasant cultivators become subject ject to repeated raiding by nomads, the cultivators may abandon their villages and join the attackers, the only route to safety. Abner Cohen (1965: 7) describes this dynamic for Palestine under the Ottomans: This was a society existing on the fringe of the desert. When security prevailed, masses of bedouin tended to settle permanently nently on the land, in the valleys and the plains, living in villages. lages. When conditions in the villages were bad-when taxation ation was heavy and the pressure of bedouin was strong-the the villagers tended to become nomadic. Nomadism had many advantages. Nomads paid no taxes, were not conscripted scripted into the army, were armed (while the peasants were prohibited from keeping arms), could amass wealth in the form of livestock without being haunted by unscrupulous tax collectors, and could even engage in occasional agriculture. ture. They did not have to go far to the desert in order to be nomads, because large tracts of fertile lands in the valleys and on the plains were available. Cohen (1965: 7, note 3) explains further: Nomadism in Palestine, therefore, should be seen, at least in part, as a method, or strategy, whereby the population protected tected itself against excessive conditions of insecurity and exploitation, ploitation, and not mainly as adaptation to ecological factors. Thus production is always influenced by ecology and economics, nomics, but also by political context. Understanding how people make a living in the Middle East requires that we consider sider political factors, such as pressure from state agents and from other population groups, as influences in the production choices made by Middle Easterners.\nHighlight(orange) - Location 383\nUntil the end of the Mandatory Period [1948], the basis of livelihood for the villagers was subsistence agriculture. The main concern of the average peasant was to secure the muna. Literally the word meant ‘provisions’ but in the living dialect it was almost synonymous with the word ‘livelihood.’ Securing the muna meant the storing of the basic foodstuffs necessary for the subsistence of the family, and the family’s livestock, for a period of thirteen months … a precaution against late harvest in the next season. [Note 1] The main items were as follows: about 450 pounds of wheat for every member of the family, a smaller quantity of barley and millet, about 100 pounds of olive oil for every member, a quantity of onions, the seeds required for the next season’s farming, and the necessary quantity of food for the livestock, mainly for the horse and oxen. (Cohen 1965: 19)\nHighlight(orange) - Location 410\nAmong strategies of security, there are two great branches: the branch of “self-help” and the branch of “authority.” “Self-help” help” is a decentralized strategy in which all individuals take it upon themselves, either individually or collectively, to provide security by directly acting in defense and attack. All men, representing resenting all families, are armed and ready to take coercive action. All men, excepting a few religious figures, regard themselves selves as warriors bound to fight, proud to fight, in defense of their families and groups. “Authority” is a centralized strategy for providing security in which specifically designated individuals uals and groups act on matters of security, defensively and offensively, on behalf of the entire population. Specific bodies of specialists-designated as police, army, judges, and prosecutors-are tors-are given responsibility for order and defense. They hold or monopolize special resources, including funds, weapons, and training, critical for coercive action. In contrast, the population lation in general is not supplied with these special resources, and is often forbidden access to them. The general populace is thus totally dependent upon the specialized agencies to maintain tain order and to defend them and their property. In both branches security is based on established institutions; tions; the difference between the branches is that for “self-help,” help,” all people and all parties are encompassed by and responsible to act through the institution, whereas for “authority,” a small number of designated individuals are responsible to act on behalf of the entire population. There is a corresponding difference in recognition of social standing in the two branches: members of societies based on strategies of “self-help” are equal with one another and share the responsibility bility and prestige; members of societies based on strategies of “authority” are divided, with those in specialized agencies of control and defense having power and prestige, and the bulk of the population in a subservient position to those with power and authority. Strategies of “self-help” thus lend themselves to more egalitarian itarian societies; strategies of “authority” to more hierarchical societies. “Self-help” is characteristic of band and tribal societies; eties; “authority” is characteristic of the state.\nHighlight(orange) - Location 431\nIbn Khaldun, 1332-1408 CE, who observed and took part in North African political life, described the tribal system and its relations with the state in detail. Ibn Khaldun (1967; see commentaries mentaries in Gellner 1981: ch. 1 and passim, Lindholm 2002: ch. 4) stressed the importance of social solidarity, unity, and mutual support among tribesmen, which is based on what he labels asabiyya, group feeling. It lies behind and is reinforced by blood feud. Group feeling and solidarity give tribesmen the capacity to withstand attack and to conquer. Asabiyya gives tribes the advantage over the premodern state, which is weakened ened by sedentary life, hierarchical stratification, and the suppression pression of aggression.\nHighlight(orange) - Location 452\nWhat accounts for the continued importance of tribes even in the presence of states? While citizens of contemporary industrial democracies sometimes view the state with a certain ambivalence, on the whole, citizens tend to see the state as the source of security and benefits. But this modern, democratic state was very late coming. Premodern states, characteristic of earlier periods of history and widely present around the world today, are not democratic, and rarely provide security or benefits. The traditional tional state is more accurately understood as a center of power controlled by warlords, robber barons, and their coercive thugs, tax collectors, and priests, the latter supplying some kind of rationalization for the forced extraction from their subjects, who were seen mainly as livestock to be milked and sheared (Gellner 1988: 21-23, 103, 145-46, and passim). The main project of early states was predatory expansion, both for loot and for control over larger populations, the milking and shearing of which would bring greater returns. The peasant subjects of the premodern, despotic state were in an unattractive tive position, subject to abuse, extortion, and expropriation by rulers, tax collectors, and soldiers alike.\nHighlight(orange) - Location 459\nIndependent tribesmen see peasants as oppressed, downtrodden, weak, lacking honor, and inferior. In contrast, tribesmen see themselves as independent of any interference, ference, free to follow their own will, as equal to each other and to anyone else, as brave warriors, as honorable men. As a result, tribesmen actively resist conquest by states, resist incorporation into states, and resist domination by agents of states. To do this, tribesmen organize independently, on their own, in order to avoid falling under the power of the state. Tribesmen say that freedom is not paying taxes (Lindholm 2002: 25-26), so keeping independent of states gives them freedom. Given the choice, tribesmen choose autonomy, freedom, equality, strength, and honor, and avoid the weakness, oppression, inequality, and dishonor suffered by the peasant.\nHighlight(orange) - Location 469\nA tribe is conceived of as a huge family descended from a common ancestor, from whom the tribe generally takes its name. Hence its segments can be figured either as a series of political sections or as genealogical branches of a clan. A tribe is divided into several, generally two or three, primary mary divisions, or sub-tribes, … They believe that they are descended from a common ancestor, who is generally a son of the ancestor of the tribe. Primary tribal divisions split into secondary divisions, and secondary divisions into tertiary divisions, and so on. Each of the smaller divisions is a replica of the larger ones… The members of each division also consider that they are descended from a common ancestor who, in his turn, is descended from the ancestor of the larger division of which they form a section. Qabila is the word generally used to denote a tribe or primary mary tribal division. Ailat [singular: ‘aila] are the lineages into which a clan is divided and hence the sections of a tribe of various sizes in which these lineages are found and after which they take their names. Biyut [singular: bait] are small lineages, or extended families, with a depth of five or six generations erations from the present day to their founders.\nHighlight(orange) - Location 486\nIt will be found that in any of the main tribes stranger groups, sometimes of client origin, have attached themselves to the clan dominant in the tribal area and through some fiction, tion, myth, or fraud, have grafted their branch of descent on to the genealogical tree of this clan. The Bedouin use the word laf to describe this process and they say that kinship established in this way may become as strong as kinship of blood… [A] lineage … often is … conceived of politically cally as an agnatic group … together with stranger and [other] accretions which occupy its territory and make common cause with it in disputes with other tribes or segments ments of the same tribe. (Evans-Pritchard 1949: 56)\nHighlight(orange) - Location 549\nThe Bedu are well aware that [modern] governments are stronger than they, politically, economically and militarily. Any government could crush the tribes in their territory at any time but they don’t, because the tribe’s cause could only too easily be taken up by an unfriendly neighbour with unpredictable results. However weak the practical nature of segmentary solidarity may be in fostering inter-tribal cooperation, operation, it is sufficiently strong for it to be a distinct threat; moreover many armies are made up largely of Bedu. The Rwala play a large part in this game of bluff and counterbluff bluff for they are very numerous and can cross borders freely and legitimately. The inter-state squabbles, which are the norm in the area at the moment, can be exploited by them fairly easily. Thus the affront to the Sha’alan [shaikhs], which affected the tribe as well, when their land was confiscated, was countered by a retreat into Jordan, which was hardly on speaking terms with Syria at the time. From there they waged economic warfare on the Ba’athists in terms of smuggling. This had certain economic effects, for the quantities of U.S. cigarettes smuggled into Syria were so enormous…\nHighlight(orange) - Location 556\nHow did this strategy work practically, and why did the Rwala Bedouin find it attractive? Lancaster (1997: 112) explains: The family camped in north-east Jordan and started up smuggling. Tribesmen who had lost their camels in the drought flocked to them and the enterprise was a success. The sheikhs saw smuggling not only as a means of making large sums of money quickly but also, as previously mentioned, tioned, as a form of economic warfare against the Syrian government, ernment, which, they felt, had treated them unfairly. Quite apart from this, the danger involved appealed to them and they (and many others) regarded smuggling as a surrogate for [traditional] raiding. It gave them the opportunity, denied them for some thirty years, of displaying traditional Bedu virtues of bravery and resourcefulness and it provided the money necessary for their casual generosity. The initial capital for this venture, i.e. for buying trucks, goods and arms, came almost entirely from the women, who sold their jewellery. Traditionally jewellery has always been a bank account… Bracelets, necklaces, medallions and headdresses, dresses, mostly of solid gold, were ruthlessly broken up and sold, the proceeds being put at the disposal of husbands, sons and brothers. As well as providing capital, it financed the family until money started to come in. The Jordanian authorities, ideologically opposed to the Ba’ath, tactfully looked the other way and the Syrian authorities were in no wise prepared for a major policing action.\nHighlight(orange) - Location 578\nIn the Middle East and North Africa, as in mainland Asia and early Europe, tribes thus were and are part of a complex social, cultural, political, and economic field that also includes states, peasants, and commercial traders. Tribes flourished because tribal life was regarded as more attractive than peasant life by many, because independence, freedom, equality, and honor were seen as tribal characteristics, while oppression, exploitation, servitude, and dishonor were seen to be the condition of peasants. ants. Of course, tribesmen were prepared to trade their independence ence for positions as rulers, which they repeatedly did by conquering quering states and setting up their own dynasties.\nHighlight(orange) - Location 594\nIf each individual belongs to many lineages, small and large, when does he act on behalf of one or another, and how does he know? Anthropologists call these lineages “contingent,” gent,” in that they do not operate all of the time, but are called into action according to the circumstances. The circumstance that calls these groups into action is conflict. The principle of affiliation used is “always side with closer kin against more-distant distant kin.” This is expressed in the famous Arab saying, “I against my brothers; my brothers and I against our cousins; my brothers and cousins and I against the world.” By applying the principle of closeness vs. distance, a tribesman always knows with whom he must side, against whom, and when to be neutral. tral. Loyalty and honor requires siding with the closer. When an individual or group is equidistant from the two conflicting parties, neutrality is the correct stance.\nHighlight(orange) - Location 646\nBut the situation remained ambiguous and could not be left as it was. It was necessary, now that the trunks had been retrieved, to inquire about the original act of misappropriation and to find out whether a state of hostility existed or did not exist. A neutral intermediary, mardi monjine (in Persian: mianji), a man without membership in either of the conflicting lineages, had to be sent to the Kamil Hanzai to clarify the situation. uation. Had a Dadolzai gone, and the discussion turned nasty, he would have been at the mercy of the Kamil Hanzai. Gemi, son of Pir Dad, of the Mir Alizai brasrend was chosen. It was said that he was a member of neither party and so was not in danger. It was not Gemi’s job to make peace, but only to inquire and then to report the current state of the relationship. Had the report been of hostility, the Dadolzai, according to some opinion, was prepared to go off the next morning in an armed group and fight it out with the Kamil Hanzai.\nHighlight(orange) - Location 714\nThis form of tribal organization, balanced opposition, the structure of which is sometimes called a “segmentary lineage system” by anthropologists, is brilliant in a number of respects. First, this is a regional system of order that can encompass hundreds of thousands of individuals, on a totally decentralized, nonhierarchical, egalitarian, and democratic basis. No officials or centralized institutions are required. Thus the autonomy, freedom, equal status, and honor of each individual vidual are enhanced. Second, balanced opposition minimizes the possibility that individuals will have to defend themselves against groups, that small groups will have to defend themselves selves against large ones, that numbers of attackers will overwhelm. whelm. In conflicts, groups tend to face others of the same genealogical level and same magnitude. The very structure of the system builds in a kind of demographic fairness.\nHighlight(orange) - Location 723\nIn addition to the constraint arising from deterrence, there is another major and much revered mechanism of social control that militates in favor of peace and stability. This is the neutral mediator, structurally equidistant in kinship from the parties in conflict, and active in resolving the dispute and reinstituting cordial dial relations between the conflicting groups. The mediator always has an evocative symbolic idiom at his disposal, because the conflicting groups are always, at a higher level of genealogy, constituent parts of a larger lineage, and, thus, at that higher level, all of the conflicting parties are kinsmen. Mediators are commonly drawn from the most respected individuals in the community, often from high status groups, and for their troubles, if they are successful, gain the greatest prestige in the society.\nHighlight(orange) - Location 861\nThe rights and obligations of individuals as members of lineages were of course spelled out normatively, but were by no means solely normative. Mutual aid, generalized reciprocity, procity, and solidarity among lineage mates were not only nice things to do. Tribesmen saw these also as in their interests, for they believed that their individual destinies were dependent upon the character of their particular lineage and how members bers of other lineages perceived it. Everyone wanted their lineages ages to be seen as solidary, brave, and tough, so that others would avoid any hostile actions. Thus any act by an outsider that could be perceived as deleterious to the interests of the lineage had to be responded to in a decisive fashion, lest others see the lineage as weak and its members as easy targets. The tribesmen believed that each offense against its members not strongly answered would lead to other offenses, and these would lead to yet more. In tribal Baluchistan, the price of security rity is eternal vigilance.\nHighlight(orange) - Location 910\nThere can be no doubt about the centrality of balanced opposition sition and tribal organization in the historical Middle East from the rise of Muhammad and the rapid expansion of the Arab Empire. Muhammad’s Arabia was a tribal region, and his constituency was Bedouin tribes who served as the shock troops and colonialists in the Arab invasions of the Levant and North Africa in the west, and Iran, India, and central Asia in the east. Even such major religious splits as that between Shi’a and Sunni were born in balanced opposition between two closely related lineages in Mecca.\nHighlight(orange) - Location 926\nThe basic principles of balanced opposition continue to be operative in Middle Eastern towns and cities. To cite just one case, conflict in contemporary Gaza leads to blood feuds between kin groups (Globe and Mail 2006): “They never saw each other as an enemy … Their families were always very close until recently.”-Nasser Khalil, an acquaintance of two Palestinian friends in Gaza, who attended the same school, prayed at the same mosque and played soccer together-yet unwittingly found themselves on opposite ends of a bloody gunfight between two rival factions last week that claimed both their lives. At first, the families of both victims, Mohammed Harazin and Ismail Abu Hair, planned revenge against each other, as is tradition when members of one clan kill another. But fighters from Islamic jihad intervened, fearing that the violence would spiral out of control. Finally, the patriarchs of each family agreed to respect a truce, which they tearfully announced in a shared statement at a Dec. 21 [2006] press conference: “From here this moment we declare our wish for this conflict to end. We are willing to forgive and forget the blood of our sons … We need to stop the blood flowing from our people.”\nHighlight(orange) - Location 933\nIn Gaza City (Ottawa Citizen 2006: A12), Violent clashes broke out early today between Hamas fighters and armed members of a powerful family clan in Gaza City, with at least one person killed and one wounded, witnesses said. … Fighting took place in the district where one of Hamas’ top officials in Gaza, Foreign Minister Mahmud Zahar, lives. His home was targeted by the powerful family, two of whose members were killed Wednesday in clashes with Hamas, and the witnesses said several Hamas members were abducted.\nHighlight(orange) - Location 937\nFourth, Islam firmly maintains the opposition between the Muslim and the infidel. As we shall see, the Muslim is opposed to the infidel, and the dar al-Islam, the land of Islam and peace, to the dar al-harb, the land of the infidels and conflict. Balanced opposition was raised to a higher and more inclusive structural level, and the newly Muslim tribes were unified in the face of the infidel enemy. We can see this manifested among the Bedouin of Cyrenaica, who, while they did not fulfill various ritual obligations with great assiduity, excused themselves by explaining “their enthusiasm for the jihad, holy war against unbelievers.” The Bedouin admitted that they do not pray regularly, ularly, but “‘nasum wa najhad’ ‘we fast and we wage holy war’” (Evans-Pritchard 1949: 63). With Muhammad’s Islamic revolution, tion, balanced opposition came to encompass the world, and to have the authorization of God.\nHighlight(orange) - Location 984\nHowever, the quest for honor goes beyond simply doing one’s duty and fulfilling one’s obligations. For Middle Easterners, erners, the search for honor and the avoidance of shame becomes a goal in its own right. This appears to be an “unintended tended consequence” of a concept evolved to cement group loyalty. alty. The result is that concerns about honor drive behavior and shape responses. Honor becomes a powerful motivator in social engagement and exchange. Calculations about material interest, and individual and group consequences, never neglect the effects on honor, which often come to outweigh other concerns.\nHighlight(orange) - Location 987\nAmong Arabs, all men are in principle equal, or, more precisely, cisely, not unequal by any prescribed ascription. That is, all men are born equal, without higher or lower rank. It is in this sense that we can say that Arab culture is decisively egalitarian. Each man, being in principle equal to all others, is also in principle ciple autonomous, making decisions for himself according to his own lights. Each man, free to act as he chooses, is thus responsible for his own actions. In this sense, we can say that Arab culture decisively encourages freedom of the individual.\nHighlight(pink) - Location 993\nAs the Arabic proverb puts it, “He who rules over you, emasculates you” (Kressel 1996: 104).\nHighlight(orange) - Location 1004\nSo it was during the thirty years, 1960-1990, between the Barabha, Shalalfa, and Trabelsiyya patrilineal kin groups in the Israeli town of Ramla, eighteen kilometers southeast of Tel Aviv. (I draw here at some length from Gideon M. Kressel’s Ascendancy through Aggression: The Anatomy of a Blood Feud among Urbanized Bedouin, 1996.) These patrilineages, with Bedouin origins, were part of an Arab population of 3,800 among 30,000 Jews in the town. The members of these lineages, ages, some of whom had lived in the town for decades, had modern occupations in mechanized agriculture, transport, and wholesale commerce. But these lineages tended to live fairly compactly, located in or around the Bedouin quarter and in public housing provided for them. As well, and more important, tant, they maintained their asabiyya, their lineage solidarity, and each maintained at least one shiqq, a meeting house, for members of the lineage (Kressel 1996: 22-23). This result is not unusual, for, as Kressel (1996: 17) explains, “molding a social landscape of patrilineage quarters … [is] the traditional pattern by which urban society in the Middle East has always been structured.”\nHighlight(orange) - Location 1027\nWith the advent of serious fighting and major injuries, members of lineages gathered in the shiqq meeting rooms along with members of allied smaller lineages to exhibit solidarity. At the same time, Israeli police intervention was initiated, with the goal of stopping the conflict and reinstituting order. The strategy of the police was to add its weight to the traditional Bedouin mediation process (Kressel 1996: 56), which involves first a preliminary cease-fire agreement, called a wujeh (literally meaning “face,” after the Bedouin notables who agree to act as guarantors of the peace), during which mediators try to work out a formal truce, ‘atwa (literally “gift,” the restraint of the injured party), which, with further mediation and negotiation, would lead to a formal reconciliation, sulh. The reports and presentations of the events by the interested ested parties also develop through phases (Kressel 1996: 59). First, each side in the fight stresses their own great prowess and the severe injuries that they visited on their opponents. Each side also denies that they themselves suffered any serious injuries. In this phase, each side is trying to bolster its honor by claiming superior strength and denying injury. Even if there is an evident winner and loser-and the judge of this is the public, the other lineages-the losing lineage tries to minimize mize its loss, just as the winner tries to maximize its victory. The second phase begins with the (informal) public verdict of victor and vanquished. Then, with mediation and compensation tion looming, the winner asserts its innocence in the conflict, and minimizes the injuries it has caused. The victim now exaggerates gerates its injuries and losses, in order to gain maximum compensation. pensation. But of the result for the allocation of honor, for public standing and for the ranking of the lineages, there is no doubt. He who gives compensation is ruled the victor; he who receives compensation is deemed the loser. The victor gains honor; the vanquished loses honor. The victor ranks higher in the hierarchy of honor than the loser.\nHighlight(orange) - Location 1055\nIt was no accident that the arrival of new recruits acted as reinforcement for the Shalalfa, and that with larger numbers they defeated the Barabha. It is always expected that the lineage eage with larger numbers will prevail, and that lineage size is equated with power. The larger the size of the lineage, the more warriors, and the lineage with the larger number of warriors riors is regarded as stronger and likely to be the victor. Larger lineages are thus ranked higher than smaller lineages (Kressel 1996: 105). Rivalries and disputes over honor generally arise, as Kressel (1996: 105) indicates, between “two groups of approximately the same size who occupy adjacent positions on the local hierarchical ladder,” each trying to avoid domination tion by the other, and each hoping to rise over the other.\nHighlight(orange) - Location 1072\nEven the formal status and genealogical place of tribes can change to reflect fait accompli. Peters (1968: 172-73) argues that a genealogy is less an accurate record of descent, than a rationalization of actual relations between groups and their territorial relations. Thus a strong and victorious Marabtin client group will be incorporated into the genealogy as a free and noble Hurr tribe. Indeed, the noblest lineage in the whole of the land is reputed to be of client origin, and the tribesmen of this lineage, eage, after recounting the circumstances which permitted their client ancestor to appropriate noblemen’s lands, boast their [noble] Sa’adi [genealogical] status. (Peters 1968: 173)\nHighlight(orange) - Location 1095\nWhat conclusions can we draw from the cases examined here? First, that group solidarity, asabiyya, and honor, are closely related. Solidarity is supported by the honor of the individual member, and the honor of the group as a whole requires solidarity. Second, that the solidarity that allows the group to defend itself also makes possible offensive action against other groups. Third, that in either defense or offense, military capacity is the decisive factor. Fourth, the number of male agnates determines military capacity. Fifth, that affronts to honor will lead to confrontations, conflicts, and combat. Sixth, competition for places in the honor ranking of groups can lead to confrontations, conflicts, and combat. Seventh, injuries and compensation received signal the loser, and a loss of honor. Eighth, in competitions for honor, there can only be winners and losers. Victors receive honor; the vanquished are humiliated. Domination is always the objective.\nHighlight(orange) - Location 1121\nIn competition, whether between individual men, between lineages, or tribes, the type of honor at stake is generally labeled sharaf. Ginat (1997: 129; see also Stewart 1994: ch. 4) defines it this way: “Sharaf is a type of honor that fluctuates according to a man’s behavior. [For example:] If a man looks after the needs of his guests and is seen to be generous erous to those in need, his honor standing is high… This type of honor can be accumulated or lost according to a man’s behavior.”\nHighlight(orange) - Location 1125\nThe other type of honor that is affected by women’s behavior is called ‘ird. Groat (1997: 129) says “‘ird, on the other hand, is a type of honor that is used ‘only in connection with female chastity and continence’ [Abou Zeid 1965: 256]. A woman cannot by exemplary conduct add to her agnates’ ‘ird, though by misbehaving she can detract from it.” For Stewart (1994: 54, 81-85), ‘ird is a kind of “horizontal honor” that he labels “personal honor”: “Two features … distinguish it from other types: first … that [it] can be lost, and second that in order to retain it one must follow certain rules, or maintain certain standards …”\nHighlight(orange) - Location 1138\nAn example of this is a story told in a number of Egyptian oral poems: An army sergeant called Mitwalli learns that his sister has become a prostitute. He tracks her down, kills her, chops up the corpse, and throws it from her balcony to the dogs [which are unclean animals for Muslims]. All this is described with unqualified approval by the authors of the poems, as is Mitwalli’s subsequent exoneration in court. The disgraceful behavior of Mitwalli’s sister was a blot on his honor, and that of his family, and could only be erased by her blood. In such cases, it is felt that blood cleans humiliation.\nHighlight(orange) - Location 1146\n“Shame is not when someone’s daughter has illicit sexual relations; the shame is when it is public knowledge that she has had illicit sexual relations.” tions.” Families of course do their best to keep misbehavior secret, but in face-to-face communities this is very difficult. Furthermore, as part of sharaf honor competition, each family is watching the others in order to find some advantage for themselves. An indiscretion by a woman of one family can be seen by other families as an opportunity to improve their relative ative positions. As Cohen (quoted in Ginat 1997: 134) puts it, “An adulterous woman, even an unmarried woman having a sexual affair with a man, must be killed by her brothers or her father’s brother’s sons. If she is killed the group not only reasserts its position but also rises in prestige scale. If she is not killed they suffer loss of prestige.” There is thus some interplay between horizontal and vertical honor."},"Research/Book-Notes/Scars-of-War,-Wounds-of-Peace_-The-Israeli-Arab-Tragedy":{"title":"Scars of War, Wounds of Peace_ The Israeli-Arab Tragedy","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Notebook Export\nScars of War, Wounds of Peace: The Israeli-Arab Tragedy\nBen-Ami, Shlomo\nCitation (APA): Ben-Ami, S.

Throughout, the Arabs’ incompetent leadership, their lack of purpose and national cohesion, proved to be a major ally of the Zionist enterprise. White Papers notwithstanding, Arab landowners ready to sell land to the Jews and to betray their own national cause were never in short supply. As no other than King Abdullah of Transjordan observed in his memoirs, ‘The Arabs are as prodigal in selling their land as they are in … weeping [about it].’\nHighlight(orange) - Page 20 · Location 507\nThe war for Palestine in 1948 was lost by the Arab community ten years before it even began. The Arab Revolt had, of course, an understandable rationale behind it, namely, to force Britain to reverse her policies in favour of the National Home for the Jews, stop immigration and curtail the land acquisition by the Zionists. But the method and the evolution of the Revolt reflected rage and blind despair more than organisation or careful strategy. The result would be a resounding defeat for the Palestinian Arabs that would bring them to the ultimate débâcle of 1948 in a state of fatalistic disarray. The years between the Arab Revolt and the Naqbah of 1948 witnessed the dismemberment of the Palestinian community and the loss of their political autonomy to the extent that when they had to face the challenge of partition and war in 1947–8, they were no longer the masters of their own destiny. By then their cause would be usurped by the neighbouring Arab states. It was not until the emergence of the Fatah movement and Yasser Arafat’s PLO in the mid 1960s that the Palestinians recovered the control of their own cause.\nII Bisecting the Land or Zionism’s Strategy of Phases?\nHighlight(orange) - Page 34 · Location 754\nThe paradox of the winter of 1947 was that the Jews, who accepted Resolution 181–the Jewish public acclaimed its endorsement by the UN with genuine outbursts of jubilation–were ready and well deployed to face a war should this be the outcome, and the Arabs, who rejected the Resolution out of hand and made no secret of their intention to subvert it, were not at all prepared for war. Ben-Gurion, who upon his appointment as the ‘defence minister’ of the Jewish Agency in 1946 made it clear that the time had now arrived for ‘a showdown of force, a Jewish military showdown’, had been for some time meticulously preparing for a war he was convinced, at least ever since the Arab Revolt, was inevitable. The Palestinians, who on 1 December 1947 made their views clear when the Arab Higher Committee declared a general strike, were totally unprepared and poorly equipped for an armed conflict. Arab society had been crumbling from within ever since the brutal repression of the 1936–9 Revolt. Leaderless and decapitated of their traditional elites, deeply fragmented, respectful and frightened of the Yishuv’s military power, and disorientated as to their real or achievable objectives, the Palestinians approached the imminent conflict and, as it turned out, their second catastrophe in a decade, in a state of disarray and fatalistic despair.\nIII The Early Years: A Missed Opportunity for Peace?\nHighlight(orange) - Page 50 · Location 1075\nOn moral grounds one could of course convincingly defend the case for the repatriation of refugees. But this was out of the question in a historical and political context, where a clash existed between an emergent Jewish state and its defeated enemies, for whom the repatriation of refugees was one way of hampering the growth and development of the newborn, yet intimidating, state against which they harboured understandable intentions of revanche. At the Lausanne Peace Conference Israel eventually agreed to the repatriation of 100,000 Palestinian refugees, but this was almost by force of habit rejected out of hand by the Arabs as too little. Too little it might have been, but Israel made the offer only with the hope of getting relief from American pressure. The Arabs clearly missed an opportunity to call Israel’s bluff.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 62 · Location 1312\nThe Israelis might have been tough negotiators, but the dysfunctionality of the Jordanian political system was now the major obstacle to a settlement. A situation was emerging in Jordan where the King’s legitimacy for striking a deal with Israel was being seriously undermined by a supposedly patriotic, pan-Arab, philo-Palestinian and pan-Islamic government. As it turned out, the annexation of the West Bank extended the borders of the Hashemite kingdom but, by Palestinising the kingdom and shifting the emphasis of Jordanian politics to a pan-Arab sensibility towards the plight of the Palestinians, it diminished the King’s power and capacity to continue being the undisputed autocratic leader he had been thus far. On 17 February 1950 the King made a last-ditch attempt to salvage something from the wreckage of his peace strategy with Israel by proposing a non-aggression pact. This was a brilliant move, for it could unleash a dynamic leading to a possible peace deal in the future. It also implicitly meant Israel’s recognition of Jordan’s annexation of the West Bank. The agreement could likewise allow Israel to claim her first political breakthrough with an Arab state and a crack in the Arab economic boycott. There were even some provisions in Abdullah’s proposal that could satisfy the Palestinians by opening judicial channels for refugees to reclaim their abandoned property in Israel. The Israeli Cabinet ratified the agreement at its meeting of 22 February, with Foreign Minister Sharett praising the ‘psychological’ importance of the document. But it was again the Jordanians, not the Israelis, who failed to deliver. Abu al-Huda’s government got cold feet and unilaterally changed both the title and the content of the agreement. It was now becoming clear that the Palestinisation of the kingdom and the rift between the King and a no longer docile political class had emerged as an insurmountable obstacle to an Israeli–Jordanian settlement, however modest its provisions. Abdullah could not allow himself the political luxury of being exposed as a yielding king in conflict with a patriotic pan-Arab government.\nIV The Rise and Fall of the Third Kingdom of Israel\nHighlight(orange) - Page 78 · Location 1595\nIt is true that the conflict existed before superpower competition and, as we can see today, it still persists after the fall of the Soviet Union. But the struggle for mastery in the Middle East by the two big powers blocked the possibility of a major peace breakthrough for years. Conspicuously, Egypt’s peace with Israel in 1979 started as a bold bilateral move behind the back of the superpowers. The Madrid Peace Conference of 1991, the Oslo accords of 1993 between Israelis and Palestinians, Israel’s peace with Jordan a year later, and the most serious attempts to reach an Israeli–Syrian settlement throughout the 1990s were all possible only after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nV The Jewish Fear and Israel’s Mother of all Victories\nHighlight(orange) - Page 87 · Location 1767\nBy pushing Palestine to the forefront of the struggle against the Jewish state, Nasser radically changed the parameters of the conflict. Now it was no longer just a border dispute between sovereign states, and one that was susceptible to a rational solution, but a conflict of an almost mythological nature over the plight of the Palestinians and their ‘inalienable’ rights, where hardly any room for compromise could exist. It is from this perspective that Sadat’s peace initiative, in the wake of the Yom Kippur War, needs to be understood. To make peace he needed to extricate Egypt’s conflict with Israel from the paralysing hold of the Palestinian dilemma into which Nasser had locked it and bring it back to the realm of rationality as a solvable border dispute between two sovereign states.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 93 · Location 1877\nLack of superpower guarantees, an almost apocalyptic fear of physical annihilation, the threat of a Nasserite Middle East bent on the destruction of Israel, a fatalistic pessimism as to the chances that the Arab world would ever reconcile itself to the existence of a Jewish state in its midst and the ever-present Holocaust complex, was the context for Ben-Gurion’s quest for a credible nuclear option. The nuclear option could also be seen as a protest against, or an alternative to, America’s reluctance to accord solid and unequivocal conventional guarantees to Israel’s existence and incorporate it into an organic regional alliance. Indeed, there were those in the Israeli political system who wanted to use the Dimona nuclear reactor as a way of pressuring America into securing Israel’s conventional capabilities.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 94 · Location 1900\nBen-Gurion oscillated frantically from a strategy of deterrence to the politics of hysteria. He bombarded world leaders with dramatic appeals for an international commitment to the independence and territorial integrity of all the states in the Middle East. Whatever territorial dreams he might have harboured in the past, he was now a keen champion of the status quo. To him, the territorial phase of Zionism was over and the safety of Israel within the borders of 1949 was his exclusive concern. Only the full demilitarisation of the West Bank and a formal defence treaty with America could set his mind at rest.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 96 · Location 1946\nNor was Jordan spared Israel’s policy of swift and disproportionate retaliations. Such was the case of the Samu Operation in November 1966. After insistently pointing at Damascus as the source of all evil, Israel suddenly and massively retaliated against Jordan in response to a local, relatively minor incident. A typical case of the feebleness of the politicians when confronted with the army’s tendency to dictate the scope and nature of military operations in a way that sometimes created new and unplanned political realities, Samu was a disproportionate operation that stood in stark contradiction to Israel’s official commitment to the stability of Hussein’s regime. Israel publicly humiliated and betrayed an Arab leader so far careful to stay aloof from the war rhetoric and practices of his Syrian neighbours in the north, and pushed him into the fold of the Arab war camp.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 97 · Location 1956\nThe Arab League summit of January 1964 in Cairo went down in history as the first official all-Arab gathering to call for Arab military preparations in order to create the conditions ‘for the final liquidation of Israel’. The decision to divert the headwaters of the River Jordan in Syria and Lebanon–a United Arab Command was created to protect the project and prepare for war–and create the Palestinian Liberation Organisation under Ahmad al-Shuqayri’s chairmanship were understandably perceived in Israel as part of an overall Arab war strategy against the Jewish state. The task of liberating Palestine from ‘Zionist imperialism’ was reiterated in the Alexandria Arab League summit later that winter, and pledges were made by the League’s members to mobilise their resources against the Zionist enemy.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 98 · Location 1994\nKing Hussein’s predicament proved to be even more serious than that of Nasser. In his case it was the very existence of his kingdom that was at stake. He did not want to be dragged into war, but was too weak to resist the tide. As much as the supposed threat posed by Israel, it was actually the pressure of Fatah and the PLO that put in jeopardy the stability of the Hashemite kingdom. For the PLO, liberating Palestine also meant overthrowing the Hashemites’ ‘colonialist rule’. The King harboured no illusions as to the ultimate rationale of the PLO’s presence in Jordan, namely, as he explicitly wrote to Nasser, ‘the destruction of Jordan’.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 100 · Location 2026\nAnd when retaliations and verbal threats failed to deter the Syrians, Rabin made it clear that his intention was to provoke the Syrians into an all-out war. In December 1966 he wrote to General Zvi Zamir, Israel’s military attaché in London: ‘an escalation with Syria is not against Israel’s interest, and in my view there is no better time than now for a confrontation with Syria. I prefer to go to war rather than allow this continuous harassment, especially if the Syrians persist in their efforts to facilitate the activity of Fatah on our border.’\nHighlight(orange) - Page 104 · Location 2115\nNor was the restless General spared Ben-Gurion’s ire. From his seclusion in the Negev desert, the Old Man had been following the evolving crisis with awe. Precisely because he shared the military’s assessment that the closure of the Straits threatened to vitiate all the achievements of the Sinai Campaign and could soon turn into a question of ‘national survival’–this was Rabin’s expression–Ben-Gurion saw all his old fears coming true: Israel was now surrounded by an all-Arab coalition aggressively supported by the Soviet Union, without being able to rely on an alliance with, or security guarantees from, a Western superpower.\nVI Sedanlaghen – The Sin of Hubris and its Punishment\nHighlight(orange) - Page 126 · Location 2512\nThere is, of course, much reason to doubt whether, even if formalised as an official peace proposal, the Arabs would have accepted the government’s peace guidelines as the platform for a full-fledged peace agreement with Israel. Israel’s shortcomings notwithstanding, the Arabs were by all accounts not yet ready for such a deal. The proof is that a more unequivocal American overture along the same lines as the Israeli Cabinet’s decision would soon be turned down by the Arabs and their Soviet patrons.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 128 · Location 2565\nAnd it was only when this euphemism was embedded in the language of a UN Security Council Resolution that Israel was ready to endorse it. The constructive ambiguity of the November 1967 Security Council Resolution Number 242, which called for peace based on the restitution of ‘territories’ instead of ‘the territories’, allowed Israel to claim that the borders would have to be modified on all fronts as a condition for peace and gave manoeuvring space to her post-war diplomacy. Resolution 242 was the result of the need to find a formula that would reconcile Israel’s unrealistic expectation to have full peace for less than all the territories, and the Arabs’ drive for a full restitution of land in exchange for a watered-down state of non-belligerency.\nHighlight(pink) - Page 129 · Location 2585\nNeither of the parties to the conflict was especially happy with Resolution 242’ s oblique and foggy formulas, least of all the Palestinians, whose problem was reduced in the Resolution to that of the humanitarian plight of refugees. The PLO’s outright rejection of 242 was an additional manifestation by the Palestinians that their struggle would from now on be independent of the Arabs’ diplomatic strategy. The Palestinians were about to disengage from the status of a tool in the hands of the Arab states to that of an independent subject in the history of the Middle East. As from the Palestinian débâcle of 1936–9 and later the 1948 Naqbah, the Palestinians had lost their independence as a national movement. They disappeared from the regional arena as autonomous players. The 1967 war, the defeat of the Arab armies with their consequent loss of a credible military option in the foreseeable future, and the relegation by Resolution 242 of the Palestinian problem to the margins of peacemaking in the region, signalled the beginning of a new phase in the history of Palestinian nationalism.\nVII Begin’s ‘Capsule Theory’ and Sadat’s ‘Separate Peace’\nHighlight(orange) - Page 154 · Location 3090\nBegin was thus positioning himself as the most eloquent and committed exponent of what could perhaps be defined as the ‘capsule theory’, namely the drive to reach a settlement with the surrounding Arab states that would ‘capsulate’, as it were, the West Bank and with it the Palestinian problem in an environment of binding peace agreements between Israel and the surrounding Arab states. This, Begin believed, would allow Israel to exercise her full control of Eretz-Israel, yet deny the Palestinians the possibility of again triggering an all-Arab war against her.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 155 · Location 3107\nSadat did not believe that a Soviet–American co-sponsorship of the peace process would bear the political fruits he wanted. He could see his fears vindicated already in a joint declaration of the superpowers that, to his dismay, endorsed the Israeli interpretation of Security Council Resolution 242 when it spoke of ‘withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in 1967’. And as to Begin, he was not yet ready to digest the concept of ‘the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people’, one of the central premises upon which the Geneva Conference was to be convened.\nHighlight(pink) - Page 158 · Location 3170\nOne lesson and legacy of Sadat’s initiative is that in highly protracted conflicts where deep emotions and historical hatred are involved, when almost every conceivable diplomatic formula has been tried, the shock of a visionary, generous and imaginative step is likely to open new and untold paths to peace. For the major problem in the Arab–Israeli conflict, as in many other intricate collisions throughout history, has always been the incapacity or unwillingness of leaders to conduct a peace policy that is not supported by what looked at the time like the legitimate, and frequently paralysing, consensus prevailing in their respective societies and polities. Leaders, more frequently than not, act as the hostages of the socio-political environment that produces them instead of shaping it. Anwar Sadat gained a privileged place in history and achieved immortality the moment he fled from the comfortable prison of inertia, and from the pseudo-solidarity and hollow rhetorical cohesion of Arab summits.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 164 · Location 3276\nVery few in the Arab world had much love for Arafat or for the PLO, ‘the cancer in our midst’, as King Hassan of Morocco defined it in his December meeting with Dayan and Tuhami. Years later this author would personally hear from the King, in his meeting with him in his Rabat palace in January 1993, similar harsh descriptions of Arafat and the PLO, an organisation he then confided to me had outlived its historical role and was becoming an obstacle to peace that needed to be dismantled. The King also related to me the advice he had given to Arafat’s deputy, Abu-Mazen, that the PLO should disband and allow the local Palestinian leadership in the territories to assume the responsibility for dealing directly with Israel. When I later reported my conversation with the King to Prime Minister Rabin he could not conceal his embarrassment, for it was precisely at that time that an Israeli team was negotiating in Oslo with a PLO delegation what later became known as the Oslo accords.\nHighlight(pink) - Page 164 · Location 3283\nSadat had no higher regard for Arafat and the PLO than King Hassan. His weariness with the Palestinians exploded into open rage when in February 1978 the chief editor of Al-Ahram and a personal friend of the President, Yusuf al-Sibai, was assassinated in Cyprus by a Palestinian squad, admittedly belonging to Abu Nidal’s splinter group, not to the PLO. To Sadat this was one more proof that Egypt was mortgaging its future for the sake of a people–‘pygmies’ and ‘hired killers’, as he put it to Israel’s Defence Minister Ezer Weizmann–who did not deserve Egypt’s sacrifices.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 168 · Location 3360\nBut it took the almost Messianic commitment of President Carter and the most assertive and robust involvement of the United States to save the process from collapse and to force the parties to shoulder the formidable price of peace. ‘None of us believe we have much of a chance to succeed,’ confided Carter to his advisers when he invited the parties to the Camp David presidential retreat for a peace summit.\nHighlight(pink) - Page 170 · Location 3394\nIt was Menachem Begin, not a left-wing radical, who subscribed at Camp David to such non-Jabotinskian concepts as these: ‘a recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and their just requirements’, ‘the resolution of the Palestinian problem in all its aspects’ and ‘the Palestinians will participate in the determination of their own future’. Moreover, not only did Begin agree to discuss the return to the territories of the displaced Palestinians who left the West Bank during the Six Day War, but he also consented to reopen the 1948 chapter, that is, to negotiate ‘the resolution of the 1948 refugee problem’. And if all this were not enough, Begin succumbed to Carter’s pressure and agreed to ‘Resolution 242 in all its parts’, thus implicitly also endorsing the Resolution’s preamble about ‘the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war’, and its possible applicability to other Arab fronts as well.\nHighlight(pink) - Page 170 · Location 3405\nIt was a capital sin that the Palestinians should have rejected such a golden opportunity to join the Camp David process at a time when the West Bank was still practically free of Israeli settlements. This was a major missed opportunity by the Palestinian leadership. What was proposed to the Palestinians at Camp David, to use Oslo terms, was to turn the whole of the West Bank into Area B, that is, an area of Palestinian administrative rule and Israeli responsibility for security. Today, twenty-five years after Camp David and twelve years into the Oslo process, the Palestinians have hardly 20 per cent of the West Bank as Area B.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 170 · Location 3410\nIn the aftermath of the Camp David accords, the Palestinians failed to do what they wisely did in 1988, namely call Israel’s bluff and join the peace process before Israel’s occupation of the West Bank had created an irreversible reality.\nHighlight(pink) - Page 170 · Location 3413\nAt Camp David he fought for every word in the text. That the Palestinians did not call his bluff and instead engaged in a struggle against what Arafat himself called ‘the Camp David conspiracy’ only facilitated the putting into practice of Begin’s grand designs on the West Bank.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 172 · Location 3439\nMenachem Begin did not make life easier for the American President now desperately shuttling between Cairo and Jerusalem. The Israeli Prime Minister did not have insurmountable opposition at home. But he, or rather his conscience, was his own opposition. In order to calm it down he now had to prove that he, who had betrayed his pledge not to dismantle settlements, would not allow this to become a precedent for the West Bank. He would enhance the building of new settlements in Judaea and Samaria and he would block any possibility of the Palestinian autonomy ushering in a Palestinian state.\nVIII The Road to Madrid\nHighlight(orange) - Page 175 · Location 3495\nBegin would not bargain over Judaea and Samaria. But Israeli rejectionism, as was frequently the case throughout the Arab–Israeli conflict, when not triggered by the Palestinians in the first place was certainly encouraged by them. The National Guidance Committee, a council of Palestinian notables in the territories, was created with one exclusive purpose, that of undermining and boycotting the autonomy talks, whatever their final objective might have been. The narrow window of opportunity that existed in 1967 for Israel to reach a deal with a local Palestinian leadership was now closed and sealed. In 1967, with Israel’s stunning victory still fresh in their mind and with the PLO still too weak to dictate the Palestinian agenda in the occupied territories, the local Palestinian leadership was eager to engage in peace talks with Israel. But Israel then preferred the politics of confusion and ambiguity. Now, thirteen years later, the PLO held the unchallenged monopoly of Palestinian politics and there was no chance whatever that any local leadership would be allowed to negotiate with Israel a watered-down autonomy plan, or any peace plan for that matter.\nHighlight(pink) - Page 176 · Location 3513\nit is important to note that the fundamentalist officer who assassinated Sadat during a military parade on 6 October 1981, the eighth anniversary of the 1973 war, did not do it because of Sadat’s peace with Israel but because of his Western tendencies; the assassin did not once mention Israel during his trial\nHighlight(orange) - Page 178 · Location 3557\nBegin’s intention was to signal through his move on the Golan the limits of the peace process, namely that Israel’s withdrawal from Sinai should not be seen by her neighbours as a precedent for other fronts. By pulling out from Sinai, Begin intimated, Israel had fulfilled the territorial aspects of Resolution 242 and no more withdrawals could be contemplated in future peace deals. From now on it would have to be ‘peace for peace’, not ‘peace for land’. Likewise, the annexation of the Golan was Begin’s way of testing the commitment of Egypt’s new President, Hosni Mubarak, to Israel’s concept of a separate peace.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 189 · Location 3773\nThe political void created by the collapse of the London agreement–and now also by the evaporation of the Shultz initiative and the threat that the Intifada posed to the stability, and perhaps even to the very existence, of the Hashemite kingdom–encouraged King Hussein to take a dramatic step. He cancelled the Act of Annexation of the West Bank to Jordan and cut all administrative links to the West Bank. His attempts so far to reconcile Jordan’s historical claims to the West Bank, his commitment to the Arab consensus on the predominant role of the PLO, and his search for a settlement with Israel was an exercise in diplomatic juggling that was no longer sustainable. He left the stage to the PLO and in one stroke eliminated for ever the so-called Jordanian option from the diplomacy of peace. From now on, if the PLO wanted the territories back it had to change its policies and come to terms directly with Israel and the United States. Jordan would no longer serve as a diplomatic buffer or bridge.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 190 · Location 3796\nIn the Intifada, as Amos Elon succinctly put it, the Palestinians discovered the power of their weakness and the Israelis the weakness of their power. The PLO was also in dire straits. Like Israel, it was taken by surprise by the Palestinian uprising. It suddenly realised that the real showdown with Israel was taking a totally different course from that preached and executed for years by an organisation of professional revolutionaries and terrorists. It was an irony of history that the biggest revolt by the Palestinians since the 1930s had begun without PLO direction. Its supremacy was now being effectively undermined by grass-roots revolutionary committees and a non-PLO United National Leadership of the Uprising (UNLU) that emerged throughout the territories and succeeded in establishing areas of Palestinian self-rule in different parts of the occupied lands. The PLO was also challenged by the dramatic surge of Islamic fundamentalist organisations like Hamas and Jihad, especially in Gaza.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 192 · Location 3844\nIn a declaration of Palestinian independence the Palestinian National Council (PNC) accepted the existence of the State of Israel and endorsed ‘all relevant UN Resolutions’, paradoxically including two mutually exclusive Resolutions, namely 242 and 181.\nHighlight(pink) - Page 196 · Location 3912\nYasser Arafat’s and the PLO’s support for Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait was certainly a major strategic blunder of the Palestinian leadership. Once again, as so often in the past, one could watch with stupor and bewilderment the self-defeating nature of Palestinian nationalism. The PLO’s failure to join a coalition based on the same key principle on which the Palestinians had built their case–a principle that was, moreover, embedded in SCR 242, about the ‘inadmissibility of acquiring territory by force’–was a sad display of political stupidity which, moreover, morally spoiled the Palestinian case. This was how Arafat misunderstood and misrepresented to his people the coalition’s war to undo the Iraqi aggression against another Arab country: These are days of glory and pride and steadfastness of our Arab nation…. The real aim of the treacherous American aggression is not to enforce compliance with UN resolutions but to destroy Palestine and the Arab nation and make way for three million Russian Jews in a greater Israel stretching from the Nile to the Euphrates.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 199 · Location 3981\nBut the Americans would not let him sleep for long. Without prior consultation with Israel and to Shamir’s dismay, they summoned the parties immediately after the conference to bilateral talks in Washington. The Prime Minister was forced against his will and judgement to send his delegations to the American capital, but this did not mean that he had any intention of budging from his known positions. The talks were a sheer waste of time, and the gap between the parties was simply unbridgeable. Israel’s withdrawal from Sinai was the implementation of SCR 242 and Israel would not execute any additional withdrawals on the other fronts.\nIX Oslo: The Glory and the Agony\nHighlight(pink) - Page 206 · Location 4106\nAt that momentous crossroads, Arafat and the PLO misjudged the post-Cold War opportunities and failed to appreciate the far-reaching shift in the structure of international relations at the end of the Cold War. By supporting Saddam Hussein’s occupation of Kuwait they isolated themselves from the international and Arab worlds, especially from their wealthy patrons in the Gulf States, and lost their major sources of income without which, rhetoric apart, the PLO simply could not exist. Arafat’s miscalculations were of historic proportions, and they brought the Palestinian cause to the verge of financial and political bankruptcy. How could he not realise that by supporting the occupation of Kuwait he was morally spoiling his case, based since 1967 on the principle inherent in Security Council Resolution 242 about ‘the inadmissibility of the acquisition of land by force’? Arafat’s miscalculation in supporting Saddam Hussein can only be compared with the Mufti’s colossal blunder in throwing in his lot with Nazi Germany in World War Two. The crisis of the PLO boosted the chances of their rivals in the territories, especially the Islamic organisations Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which suffered no financial problems. Both Iran and Saudi Arabia continued to lavish budgets and gifts on them.\nHighlight(pink) - Page 210 · Location 4188\nArafat’s strategy was based on permanent negotiations, the desired outcome of which was never clear to him, nor was he ever able to spell it out so that the Israelis could weigh the final price they would have to pay to reach the end of the conflict. Arafat never managed, nor did he ever try, to convey to the Israelis that he had a sense of the finality of the conflict. Terror, including that perpetrated by Hamas, was to him a strategic weapon he used to soften the resistance of the Israelis. The Oslo accords had made available to him the conditions for waging a total war against Israel, and he would use them at the proper moment. At a Palestinian meeting in the West Bank town of Nablus in January 1996, just before an unprecedented wave of suicide terrorism brought about Shimon Peres’s electoral defeat to Benjamin Netanyahu, Nabil Shaath, a close associate of Arafat, explained the deeper meaning of Oslo from the PLO’s perspective. If the terms of the Palestinians for a settlement with Israel were not accepted, he said, We shall return to violence. But this time this will be done with 30,000 Palestinian soldiers at our disposal and while we control a territory of our own, and enjoy freedom and liberty … If we reach a dead end, we will resume the war and struggle exactly as we did forty years ago.\nHighlight(pink) - Page 213 · Location 4255\nHardly had the ink on the agreements dried when a Palestinian opposition of Islamic and secular Rejectionists, some from within Fatah itself, started to work against them. In his rush to sideline the local leadership and stem the upsurge of Hamas, Arafat, his critics would say, agreed to turn the PLO from a national movement into the sheriff of a small, destitute ghetto in Gaza. Hamas and Jihad lost no time in unleashing a campaign of terror in the hope that this would lead to the radicalisation of Israeli public opinion and, consequently, to a shift to the right, which they expected would undermine and cripple Rabin’s peace policies. On the very eve of the signing of the DOP, three Israeli soldiers were slaughtered by a Hamas squad in Gaza. Suicide terrorism was not the invention of the second Intifada. It had already started in the euphoric days of Oslo. The day after the DOP was signed, on 14 September 1993, a Palestinian terrorist blew himself up in an Israeli police station in Gaza. But the bad omens for the future of Oslo did not come only from the Islamic opposition. On 11 May 1994, a week after he had signed the Cairo agreement establishing the modalities for Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho and a few days before he himself returned to an ecstatic reception in Gaza, Arafat called, in a speech behind closed doors in Johannesburg, for a Jihad to recover Jerusalem. He went to the extreme of comparing Oslo with the Prophet’s tactical Hudaybiyya agreement of AD 625 with the Qurayish tribe, an expedient peace that could be broken when the circumstances would warrant it. Though he liked to position himself as a Palestinian Mandela, or as the leader of a modern secular movement of national liberation, Arafat remained essentially loyal to his youth as a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and, as such, his real hero and model was the Mufti, Haj Amin al-Huseini, as he himself recognised in an interview with the Palestinian daily Al-Kuds of 2 August 2002.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 214 · Location 4269\nAs it turned out, the Johannesburg speech was not an isolated incident where Arafat simply got carried away. He uttered similar notions on other occasions. One such was a speech in Gaza’s al-Azhar University on the day celebrating the ascension of the Prophet to heaven, where he spoke again of Hudaybiyya as a ‘despised peace’. On another occasion, a meeting with an Arab audience in Stockholm as quoted by Yedidia Atlas from the Norwegian newspaper Dagen, Arafat presented the right of return and the demographic weapon as his way to subvert the spirit of the Oslo accords: ‘We of the PLO will now concentrate all our efforts on splitting Israel psychologically into two camps. … We will make life unbearable for the Jews by psychological warfare and population explosion.’ 1 This was to be Arafat’s mode of behaviour throughout the Oslo years. His was always the language of battle and Jihad. ‘We stand by our oath to pursue the battle,’ he promised in his speech at al-Azhar, where he also embraced the memory of Izzedin al-Qassam, the icon of Hamas’s struggle against the ‘Zionist entity’. He would never convey a clear message of peace and reconciliation to the Israeli public. A born master of double talk, he always preferred the language of ambiguities. Throughout his life as a terrorist and guerrilla leader, Arafat avoided an open confrontation with his rivals in the movement. He preferred to co-opt them. Holding the national movement together at all costs, shunning clear-cut divisive decisions, forever looking for leadership through consensus even when this meant not curbing the terrorist activities of those he had pledged to discipline in the Oslo accords–such was his disastrous and eventually self-defeating way of government throughout. An autocrat with no interest whatever in a modicum of good government or in policies of welfare and economic development, he was unable to create the necessary popular, democratic legitimacy for cracking down on Hamas.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 215 · Location 4289\nA few days before he was gunned down, on 28 September 1995, Oslo II, an agreement practically ending Israel’s coercive control over the Palestinians, was signed in Washington.\nHighlight(pink) - Page 216 · Location 4302\nIsrael’s annexationist policies further undermined Arafat’s legitimacy for making concessions and reinforced his instinct that he could not be seen as openly collaborating with the Israelis in fighting terrorism. This, in its turn, limited Rabin’s capacity to move forward in the process. Caught between the terror of the fundamentalists, Arafat’s passivity, and the inevitable ascendancy of the peace sceptics and the Israeli far right, Rabin was marching to his political demise. The frivolous oxymoron coined by Peres that the Israelis killed in terrorist attacks–between 1993 and 1996 about 300 Israelis were assassinated by suicide squads–were the ‘victims of peace’ was utterly rejected by the public. Terrorism undermined the legitimacy and the moral foundations of the peace process. Neither Arafat nor Rabin was now in a position to give the other the minimum required to keep Oslo alive. When Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish fanatic as a traitor who sold out Eretz-Israel, he was already severely crippled politically by a series of devastating suicide terrorist attacks, notably in Tel Aviv and Beit Lid, and by Arafat’s failure to face the enemies of peace in his own camp.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 217 · Location 4321\nNetanyahu’s victory was bad news for the peace process which, admittedly, was in very poor health when he inherited it. But conspicuously, two Arab leaders, Mubarak and Hussein, did not exactly mourn the defeat of Peres. Peres’ persistent belief in a ‘warm’ peace and a ‘New Middle East’ of economic integration–he even launched the bizarre idea of having Israel join the Arab League–was anathema to Mubarak. He preferred a more controlled, slower, perhaps even reasonably tense peace with Israel, better suited to his domestic concerns and his regional aspirations. As to King Hussein, he was so taken aback by Peres’s moves towards a quick deal with Syria and so worried that Oslo under his leadership might usher in a Palestinian state that would not respect Jordan’s domestic and regional concerns that he even ventured to make public his preference for Netanyahu.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 219 · Location 4365\nParadoxically, Assad was indirectly responsible for the Oslo agreement. It was the failure of his Syrian enterprise that brought Rabin to the White House lawn in Washington for his historic handshake with Arafat. It was precisely when the Oslo agreement was almost ready in early August 1993 that Rabin made his last and most dramatic attempt to stick to the capsule theory and to reach a deal with Assad. He conveyed to him a hypothetical readiness to accept Syria’s territorial claims if Syria would in turn accept Israel’s demands on security and normalisation. Assad’s disheartening response–he utterly rejected Israel’s concept of ‘normalisation’, and insisted on symmetrical and reciprocal security arrangements that would also affect the Israeli side of the new border–prompted Rabin to give the green light to the completion of the Oslo accords later that month. Israel’s chief negotiator with Assad’s men, Itamar Rabinovich, later recalled how Rabin expounded his rationale to Secretary of State Warren Christopher: ‘If Assad were to come forward and an Israeli–Syrian deal were to be made, then this would be supplemented by a small Palestinian deal. If Assad’s response is disappointing, there would be no Israeli–Syrian breakthrough, so then there would be a major Israeli–Palestinian agreement.’\nHighlight(orange) - Page 220 · Location 4385\nThe hysteria in Jordan was such that the moment he knew of the Oslo accord, the King ordered the closure of the bridges linking the West and the East Banks for fear of a mass exodus of Palestinians that would end up subverting the Jordanian state. The May 1994 Israeli–PLO economic agreement was an additional threat to Hussein, who now saw his kingdom’s economic ties with the West Bank seriously undermined. To the King a common Israeli–Palestinian economic space meant unemployment and political instability in Jordan.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 221 · Location 4398\nArafat’s handshake with Rabin was the alibi and legitimisation that Hussein had been looking for ever since he ascended the throne, in order openly to pursue the legacy of his grandfather’s peace policy with Israel. Now it was no longer the Jordanian option at the expense of the Palestinians, as both Israel and Jordan wanted it in the past, but a desperate rush to save Jordan’s interests and perhaps its very existence as an independent Bedouin kingdom, at a moment when the Palestinian option was picked up by Israel. It became vital for Hussein to make peace with Israel if he wanted to make sure that his nemesis, Arafat, would not have an exclusive say about the future of Jerusalem and the West Bank.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 221 · Location 4403\nIt is an interesting reflection on the nature of the peace process as it developed in the Rabin years that, notwithstanding the high degree of commitment of the Clinton administration to the process, whatever was achieved–Oslo and the peace with Jordan–was done bilaterally with very little, if any, American involvement. The Americans were throughout sceptical that Hussein would dare to depart from his traditional policy of sitting on the fence. They did not realise how imperative the Oslo agreement made Jordan’s necessity to reach a settlement with Israel. Clearly, however, a much needed debt relief that the Clinton administration offered as a lure to the King if he made peace with Israel was a crucially important bonus that Hussein could not afford the luxury of ignoring.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 222 · Location 4417\nNetanyahu stalled the peace process with the Palestinians, exhibited an indifferent attitude towards Jordan’s economic expectations and even irresponsibly humiliated the King by taking the liberty of allowing an attempt–abortive, as it turned out–by the Mossad against the life of a Hamas leader, Khaled Mashal, in Amman in broad daylight.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 232 · Location 4622\nArafat ruled over one of the most expensive power machines in the world and certainly one that was utterly disproportionate to the ridiculously small slices of territory it was supposed to govern.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 233 · Location 4639\nRabin, who in his inaugural speech at the Casablanca economic summit lashed out against Arafat in the most extreme and harshest terms for daring to challenge Israel’s monopoly over Jerusalem, would have by no means agreed–as indeed his widow was to ascertain when she later in her turn criticised Ehud Barak’s excessive concessions at Camp David–to the kind of compromises that the Barak government was ready to make on Jerusalem and on the other core issues of the conflict.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 234 · Location 4659\nProbably one of the deficiencies of the Oslo accord–at the same time the reason for its initial success–was that it started as an agreement on the lowest common denominator possible in Israeli society: the idea of getting rid of Gaza did not entail any national trauma.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 234 · Location 4662\nBoth Arafat and the Israeli leadership would still have to break in a more profound and dramatic way the internal consensus in their respective societies. Arafat would have to fight the extremist organisations in a more frontal and resolute way, and he would have to make concessions on refugees and other sensitive issues he was clearly unwilling to contemplate. As to Israel, she would have to conceive solutions on settlements and Jerusalem no relevant Israeli leader, including Rabin, had ever dreamed he would have to envisage.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 235 · Location 4675\nThe truth of the matter was, moreover, that by the time Rabin was murdered the peace process was, for all practical purposes, in a state of political coma.

But instead of seizing the opportunity and assuming the inevitable price for peace, Barak risked losing a vital asset, Assad’s trust, and avoided making the necessary commitment on the border. He conveyed to the Americans and the Syrians a sense of urgency, but at the moment of truth and decision he got cold feet and engaged in tactical manoeuvres with the hope of wresting a better deal from Assad.\nHighlight(blue) - Page 243 · Location 4831\nShepardstown peace conference\nHighlight(orange) - Page 245 · Location 4859\nThere might have been a chance for a peace deal with Assad in December 1999 and January 2000 on terms that were not at all easy for the Israeli public to accept.

A terminally sick man, Assad had by then lost interest. His priority now was managing the succession of his son, not the agonising complexities of a peace deal with Israel.\nHighlight(blue) - Page 245 · Location 4862\nClinton–Assad Geneva summit\nHighlight(orange) - Page 246 · Location 4877\nThe Syrian track ended with no deal, but with a twofold legacy that Arafat was both forced and happy to embrace. Assad taught him that it was perfectly possible to say ‘no’ to America, and even publicly humiliate her President, without paying a price, and that, regardless of the ambiguities of the Oslo agreement, the 1967 borders were sacrosanct and therefore needed to be a categorical requirement in any future peace negotiations with Israel. Peace, Assad taught the Palestinians about to start their negotiations with Israel for a final settlement, needs to be based on one unyielding condition: full and unequivocal withdrawal from the occupied territories.\nHighlight(pink) - Page 246 · Location 4882\nAddressing the Camp David summit, as some commentators do, separately from the entire negotiating process–that is, independently of the negotiations that were conducted for many subsequent months in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, the Bolling air base on the outskirts of the American capital, where on 23 December 2000 President Clinton presented his final parameters for a settlement, and finally Taba–distorts, of course, the picture as to what exactly were the proposals that Arafat refused to accept. To his last day, the Palestinian leader was still reluctant to acknowledge the real nature of the deal he was offered, and he obstinately kept repeating that he had no option but to reject the ridiculous map of enclaves and ‘Bantustans’ that was presented to him by an American–Israeli conspiracy.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 248 · Location 4916\nIsrael also contemplated the risk that Palestinian belligerency might be expressed in the future as part of an all-out confrontation by an Arab or Islamic coalition against the Jewish state. The demilitarisation of the future Palestinian state had therefore been, throughout, a standard, primary Israeli requirement.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 248 · Location 4934\n‘And as to the swaps,’ he said to the President, ‘I trust you and I accept your judgement. You decide.’ Arafat later reversed his position, but this moment in the summit clearly reflected his view of the peace process as not being about a mundane bargaining over real estate. Land mattered to him far less than emotional, legendary and Islamic values such as Jerusalem, the Temple Mount (Haram al-Sharif for the Muslims), and the core of the Palestinian national ethos, namely refugees.\nHighlight(pink) - Page 249 · Location 4942\nAs it turned out, Arafat’s ‘deposit’ became the deathtrap in which the summit was eventually consumed.\nHighlight(pink) - Page 249 · Location 4946\nRefugeeism, Jerusalem and Islamic values more than land and real estate were the insurmountable obstacles that prevented an agreement at Camp David and later at Taba.\nHighlight(pink) - Page 249 · Location 4955\nAkram Hania, one of Arafat’s closest men at Camp David, put it this way: ‘At Camp David we intended to make the Israelis face the tribunal of history, face the victims of their crime and sin. Israel wanted to silence for ever the voice of the witnesses to the crime and erase the proof of the Naqbah.’\nHighlight(orange) - Page 250 · Location 4963\nIn a long meeting I had with him in Nablus through the night of 25 June 2000, that is, a fortnight before Camp David, he was careful to remind me, when our conversation moved to the chapter on Jerusalem, of the Umar Treaty of AD 638, signed between the Khalif Umar, the conqueror of Jerusalem, and the Byzantine Patriarch Sopronius, where, so Arafat instructed me, the conditions of the capitulation of the Christians included a prohibition on the Jews living in Jerusalem. Arafat’s ambition to emulate Umar el-Kutab was no mere anecdote.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 250 · Location 4969\n‘Instead of repeatedly rejecting the Israelis’ proposals, make counter proposals,’ Clinton would tell the Palestinians at Camp David. Rob Malley, in the analysis of the summit he co-authored with Hussein Agha, repeated this remark: ‘Indeed, the Palestinians’ principal failing is that from the beginning of the Camp David summit onward they were unable either to say yes to the American ideas or to present a cogent and specific counterproposal of their own.’\nHighlight(orange) - Page 251 · Location 4985\nTo my remark in the speech that Israel had come to the limits of her capacity for compromise with the Palestinians, the ambassador rightly and cunningly responded, ‘Why should we believe you when everybody remembers that you started your voyage into the Palestinian question with Golda Meir denying that a Palestinian people existed at all, and at Camp David you agreed to give away the bulk of the West Bank for an independent Palestinian state and divide Jerusalem? These certainly cannot be the outer limits of your concessions.’\nHighlight(orange) - Page 252 · Location 4999\nWe made enormous progress at the secret channel in Stockholm between Abu-Ala and Hassan Asfour on the Palestinian side and myself and Gilead Sher on the Israeli side. But the exposure of the channel by the Palestinians themselves–as part of an internal political struggle within the Palestinian camp, Abu-Mazen’s people leaked the talks to Al-Hayat–destroyed any possibility for further progress. The channel stopped because it was not producing any longer. Exposed by his political rivals back home, who leaked imaginary details about his ‘irresponsible’ concessions, Abu-Ala quickly retreated to the safety of old, unyielding positions.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 252 · Location 5004\nAnd if this were not enough, by 15 May, the day of the Naqbah, the Palestinians, with Arafat’s connivance (he ignored advance warnings by both Israelis and Secretary Madeleine Albright), unleashed throughout the territories days of violent disturbances that ended in the inevitable clashes with Israel’s security forces.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 252 · Location 5016\nFrom the moment the Swedish channel was dissolved it became clear that Arafat’s insistence that the summit be ‘better prepared’ was just a euphemism which meant that Israel should come closer to his positions under the threat of war without him having to budge from them.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 253 · Location 5034\nElusive, non-committal, the master of double talk, Arafat turned the negotiations with him, to use Lloyd George’s description of a similar occasion with De Valera, into a futile exercise of ‘trying to pick up Mercury with a fork’.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 255 · Location 5062\nIt is therefore unfair to claim, as Rob Malley and Hussein Agha did in their New York Review of Books article, that Barak’s all-or-nothing approach was a corridor leading either to an agreement or to confrontation. If this is true, the blame should clearly be shared with Arafat. But the truth of the matter is that at key moments at Camp David, when it was clear that a final settlement was impossible to reach, both the Israelis and the Americans tried fall-back plans for interim or partial settlements that were rejected out of hand by the Palestinians.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 256 · Location 5082\nAmerica was not there, as some Palestinians might have thought, just to deliver Israel to a passive and rejectionist Arab side that was unwilling to engage in a serious negotiating process, nor would Israel allow herself to be delivered unconditionally. By failing to advance clear proposals and counter-proposals, that is, by refusing to engage in a real negotiating dynamic, the Palestinians deprived the Americans of the vital tools they needed to be able to put pressure on the Israelis. The President and his team could never ascertain whether the Palestinians were at all serious and genuine in their commitment to reach a settlement. As the President repeatedly told Arafat, he was not expecting him to agree to US or Israeli proposals, but he was counting on him to offer something, to produce a new idea that he could take back to Barak in order to convince him to make more concessions. ‘I need something to tell him,’ he implored. ‘So far I have nothing.’\nHighlight(pink) - Page 256 · Location 5092\nArafat preferred to die as a defeated hero who did not give in, like Nasser, than be slain as a man of peace like Sadat.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 256 · Location 5097\nTo no avail. Arafat would not budge from his position and would not agree to a qualified Palestinian sovereignty on the Temple Mount–he was offered in the site a ‘sovereign custodianship’ that was free of any Israeli interference–or to anything that was not the unequivocal partition of the city. He was offered a capital in Arab Jerusalem (not just Abu-Dis, as all kinds of non-official back channels had suggested in the past) that would include some Palestinian quarters under full Palestinian sovereignty and the others under a more qualified Palestinian sovereignty. Arafat demanded the sovereignty of three-quarters of the Old City and rejected out of hand any bridging ideas such as a special regime, which I had the opportunity to defend throughout the summit, or the President’s proposal, accepted by the Israelis, to divide the holy basin into two equal parts, the Christian and Muslim quarters to the Palestinians and the Jewish and Armenian quarters to the Israelis.\nHighlight(pink) - Page 257 · Location 5104\nMembers of the Palestinian delegation at Camp David used to say to their Israeli counterparts that Jerusalem and the Temple Mount, the issues that more than any others wrecked the summit and prevented an agreement, were ‘Arafat’s personal obsession’, which they did not necessarily share.\nHighlight(blue) - Page 257 · Location 5112\nSaladin,\nHighlight(blue) - Page 258 · Location 5119\n‘Alissra Day’)\nHighlight(orange) - Page 259 · Location 5147\nHence Arafat would not accept a solution to the Palestinian problem that was strictly temporal and exclusively political. It needed to include, for example, the full and unconditional sovereignty over the holy places, first and foremost the Haram al-Sharif, where the Dome of the Rock is the architectural expression of Islam as a religion that supersedes and is superior to all other religions. The Jews’ claim to a sovereign right in the Temple Mount on the basis of historical and religious links to the site was, as far as he was concerned, to be utterly excluded.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 259 · Location 5152\nAt Camp David Arafat destroyed with his own hands the unique, even intimate, relationship that he had developed with the American administration in recent years. I personally had the opportunity to warn Mr Arafat, in the course of a meeting at his residence at Camp David, where I came, together with General Amnon Shahak, to make up for Barak’s obstinate refusal to meet the Palestinian leader.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 260 · Location 5168\nNabil Amr, a minister in Arafat’s Cabinet, was courageous enough to spell out his criticism in an article in Al-Hayat-el-Jadida, a mouthpiece of the Palestinian Authority, two years into the Al-Aqsa Intifada, that is, when it was becoming tragically clear that Arafat’s abandonment of the political path had brought about the destruction of the very backbone of Palestinian society: Didn’t we dance when we heard of the failure of the Camp David talks? Didn’t we destroy the pictures of President Clinton who so boldly presented us with proposals for a Palestinian state with border modifications? We are not being honest, for today, after two years of bloodshed we ask exactly that which we then rejected. … How many times did we agree to compromises, which we later rejected in order to miss them later on? And we were never willing to draw the lessons from our behaviour. … And then, when the solution was no longer available, we travelled the world in order to plead with the international community for what we had just rejected. But then we learnt the hard way that in the span of time between our rejection and our acceptance the world has changed and left us behind. … We clearly failed to rise up to the challenge of history.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 261 · Location 5189\nBut the Israeli leader nevertheless left the summit a different man, one who had the courage to depart from his old archaic beliefs. Arafat, however, would confine himself to rejecting American and Israeli proposals without ever advancing his own counter-proposals. Unlike both Begin and Sadat, Arafat acted throughout the summit more like a politician than a statesman bent on looking for a solution and seeking a historical breakthrough. Sadat in Camp David I and Barak in Camp David II were more restless, far more creative.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 261 · Location 5197\nMoshe Dayan, Ezer Weizmann and Aharon Barak would always look for new ideas and possible compromises. And when the moment of truth arrived and Begin was required to take an agonising decision on the settlements in northern Sinai, he received a vitally crucial telephone call from the most hawkish of his ministers back home, Ariel Sharon, which encouraged him to dismantle them. The only telephone calls Ehud Barak would receive from Israel during the summit were those with the disheartening news about the disintegration of his coalition and the collapse of his home front.\nHighlight(pink) - Page 262 · Location 5205\n‘I don’t even know what is exactly my mandate in these negotiations,’ the Israelis were once told by Saab Erakat, the Palestinian chief negotiator at the summit.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 263 · Location 5221\nCarter had a bulldog-like persistence about him that was absent in Clinton’s performance. Clinton did not lack Carter’s Messianic zeal; but he lacked his capacity to intimidate, nor were he and his team capable of employing the kind of brutal manipulative tactics that the Nixon–Kissinger team had used in launching the peace process in the aftermath of the 1973 war, or those that would be used by the Bush–Baker tandem in the diplomatic arm twisting leading to the Madrid Conference in 1991. At Camp David, America looked like a diminished and humbled superpower, unable to assert its will.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 264 · Location 5252\nAs early as 4 March 2000 Marwan Barghouti, the head of the Fatah militias (‘ Tanzim’) in Ramallah and a future leader of the Intifada, could not have been more specific when he made it clear to a Palestinian newspaper, Akhbar-el-Khalil, that: Whoever thinks it is possible to resolve issues such as the refugees, Jerusalem, the settlements and the borders through negotiations is under a delusion. On these issues, we have to wage a campaign on the ground alongside the negotiations. I mean armed confrontation. We need dozens of campaigns like the Al-Aqsa Tunnel Campaign.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 265 · Location 5256\nBut it was Israel’s withdrawal from Lebanon in June 2000 that served as a major incentive for the Palestinian Intifada.\nHighlight(pink) - Page 265 · Location 5263\nThe same evening and in the same city, Nablus, driven and inspired by the example of the Hezbollah, Arafat would say to a grand gathering of Fatah youth, ‘We are fighting for our land and we are prepared to erase the peace process and restart the armed struggle.’ ‘I am a general who never lost a battle,’ he told me at the same meeting in Nablus, where I tried to convince him of the need to go to a negotiating summit at Camp David. He rejected the possibility that anybody, even the President of the United States, would expect him to engage in negotiations. ‘I am a decision maker, not a negotiator,’ he told me. In retrospect, I am not sure he was a decision maker either.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 266 · Location 5277\nAnd, most important, rather than controlling or stemming the tide of a spontaneous uprising he preferred to ride on it, thus practically turning it into official policy. It was he who had encouraged the outburst of violence on the Naqbah Day of May 2000, thus undermining the Swedish secret channel of negotiations, and he later gave more than one indication that he would welcome a return to armed struggle if Camp David failed.\nHighlight(pink) - Page 266 · Location 5280\nMamduh Nufal, an adviser of his, quoted him to this effect in the Nouvel Observateur of 1 March 2001. His Minister of Posts and Communications, Imad Faluji, declared in a speech in a refugee camp in south Lebanon that the Intifada against Israel was carefully planned after the failed Camp David talks in July 2000 ‘by request of President Yasser Arafat, who predicted the outbreak of the Intifada as a complementary stage to the Palestinian steadfastness in the negotiations, and not as a specific protest against Sharon’s visit to Al-Haram Al-Quds. … The Palestinian Authority instructed the political forces and factions to run all materials of the Intifada.’\nHighlight(orange) - Page 267 · Location 5295\nHe gave an implicit green light to the uprising by doing what he frequently liked to do in such conditions: he left the country in the very first days of the Intifada in order not to have to assume responsibility. Only through the Intifada could he restore his and the Palestinians’ international standing that had been so seriously eroded by the worldwide perception after the Camp David summit–a perception strongly enhanced by Clinton’s finger-wagging at Arafat as chiefly responsible for the collapse of the summit–of an Israeli government ready for a far-reaching compromise facing obstinate Palestinian rejectionism. Arafat knew that Palestinian casualties played in his favour in world opinion and helped increase the international pressure on Israel.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 268 · Location 5319\nThe Israelis were left to assume the worst about Palestinian intentions, such as that they had never really intended to reach a settlement and that Oslo was for the Palestinians nothing but a strategic ploy aimed at doing away with the State of Israel altogether. Which is why opinion polls showed that two years into the Intifada only 20 per cent of Israelis believed that not even a signed peace agreement with the Palestinians would bring with it the end of violence and conflict.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 268 · Location 5332\nAs it turned out, the Intifada could not usher in a negotiated settlement precisely because, lacking attainable objectives, it raised the expectations of the Palestinians to unrealistic heights. Not an Israeli negotiator, but Hani al-Hassan, an old-time associate of Arafat, was forced to acknowledge that not only was the Intifada devoid of clear strategic objectives, it also raised the expectations of the Palestinian masses to such heights that it became impossible for their own leaders to meet. The Intifada, he wrote, ‘obliges our negotiators to raise the level of demands in the negotiations’ in a way that made it out of the question for Israel to accept them.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 269 · Location 5339\nArguably, since he always identified the cause of his people with his own person as the embodiment of their national will, he believed that safeguarding the interests of the PLO and his own personal rule was tantamount to promoting the national cause.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 269 · Location 5348\nAlthough there were plenty of indications that he had been for some time pushing for a shift of strategy from negotiations to violence, he probably did not initiate the uprising with specific orders.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 269 · Location 5353\nAgain, as in the first Intifada, leading the uprising was for Arafat a move of political survival, not the insight of a statesman with a clear strategic objective.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 270 · Location 5364\n–A Palestinian sovereign state on 97 per cent of the West Bank and a safe passage, in the running of which Israel should not interfere, that would link the Gaza Strip, all of which, clean of Jewish settlements, would be also part of the Palestinian state, to the West Bank. Additional assets within Israel–such as docks in the ports of Ashdod and Haifa–could be used by the Palestinians so as to wrap up a deal that for all practical purposes could be tantamount to 100 per cent territory. Needless to say, the Jordan Valley, the mythological strategic asset sanctified by generations of Israeli generals, would be gradually handed over to full Palestinian sovereignty.–Jerusalem would be divided to create two capitals, Jerusalem and Al-Quds, along ethnic lines. What is Jewish would be Israeli and what is Arab would be Palestinian.–The Palestinians would have full and unconditional sovereignty on the Temple Mount, that is, Haram al-Sharif. Israel would retain her sovereignty on the Western Wall and a symbolic link to the Holy of Holies in the depths of the Mount.–With regard to refugees, it was stated that the Palestinians would have the right ‘to return to historical Palestine’ but with ‘no explicit right of return to the State of Israel’. They could be admitted to Israel in limited numbers and on the basis of humanitarian considerations, but Israel would retain her sovereign right of admission. Refugees could be settled, of course, in unlimited numbers not only in the Palestinian state, but also in those areas within Israel that would be handed over to the Palestinians in the framework of land swaps (the Palestinians were supposed to receive an Israeli territory equivalent to 3 per cent of the surface of the West Bank). In addition, a multibillion-dollar fund would be put together to finance a comprehensive international effort of compensation and resettlement that would be put in place.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 271 · Location 5379\nClinton’s peace plan, 2000–In matters of security the President endorsed the Palestinians’ rejection of the concept of a completely ‘demilitarised state’ and proposed instead the concept of a ‘non-militarised state’ whose weaponry would have to be negotiated with Israel. A multinational force would be deployed along the Jordan Valley to replace the IDF. (The President recognised the need of the Israeli air force to co-ordinate with the Palestinians the use of their air space, as well as the IDF’s necessity to have three advance warning stations for a period of time.)\nHighlight(pink) - Page 272 · Location 5387\nThe Israeli government met the deadline. Our decision, at the height of the Palestinian Intifada, in the midst of sweeping opposition on the part of the army–it was almost tantamount to a coup d’état that the Chief of Staff, General Mofaz, should have gone public to criticise the government’s endorsement of the parameters as an ‘existential threat to Israel’–and strong reservations from the opposition and public opinion, was a daring decision of a government (then already a minority government) of peace that stretched itself to the outer limits of its legitimacy in order to endorse positions its opponents labelled as suicidal, and as being an affront to Jewish values and history. But Arafat lingered. He refused to respond. As usual, he resumed his journeys throughout the world as if he were the travelling Emperor Hadrian, in the hope of evading any decision: another meeting with Mubarak, one more trip to Ben-Ali, another trip to Jordan, a further meeting of the Arab foreign ministers, dozens of calls from world leaders from the President of China to the Grand Duke of Luxembourg urging the Palestinian leader to seize this last opportunity, to grab the historic moment.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 273 · Location 5399\nBoth the Saudi and the Egyptian ambassadors in Washington, Bandar Bin Sultan and Nabil Fahmi, who came to encourage Arafat, in the name of their respective governments, to accept the President’s parameters as a last opportunity for peace that should not be missed, were dismayed at the behaviour of the Palestinian leader. And so was the Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah. He was said to be shocked that Arafat had wasted such an opportunity and that he had lied about the President’s offer on Jerusalem. Arafat’s rejection of the peace parameters was a ‘crime’ not only against the Palestinians but against the entire region, concluded the Saudi ambassador in a long interview published in the New Yorker on 24 March 2002.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 274 · Location 5422\nBarak’s attitude to Taba was genuinely expressed on two occasions. One was when he allowed me to open, in Taba, a secret channel with Abu-Ala in order to explore freely the possibility of bridging the gaps and come to a last-moment breakthrough. The second occasion was when he made a radical shift in his position and virtually agreed to the concept of equal swaps of land.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 274 · Location 5431\nIsrael proposed in Taba physically to dismantle, or hand over to the Palestinians for the use of returning refugees, more than one hundred settlements. But those that formed coherent blocs adjacent to the 1967 line were supposed to remain as such under Israel’s sovereignty. However, as the maps that the Palestinians produced at Taba showed, our interlocutors totally rejected the very concept of blocs and referred to the settlements more as isolated outposts that would have to be linked separately from each other to Israel. Israel could not accept such an approach for it contradicted her entire peace strategy, and the Palestinians not only knew it but have always accepted it. All the back-track channels, either official or freelance, ever conducted by Israelis and Palestinians before Taba and after, were based on the acceptance by the Palestinians of the principle of settlement blocs.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 275 · Location 5446\nThe Palestinians’ lack of interest in a deal in Taba was made patently clear when Yossi Sarid, probably the most emblematic ‘dove’ of Israeli politics and now a member of the Israeli delegation, proposed a Solomonic solution to the differences still pending between the parties on Jerusalem: the Temple Mount, the Western Wall, the Old City and the holy belt leading from the Old City to the Mount of Olives. Had the Palestinians agreed to stick to the letter and the spirit of the Clinton parameters there should have been no reason for such differences to exist, but Mr Sarid thought nevertheless that an attempt should be made to reach a compromise by going the extra mile towards meeting the reservations of the Palestinians. ‘Let us split the burden between us,’ he suggested; ‘two of the four issues pending will be solved according to your position, and two according to ours, which is, as you know, respectful of the Clinton parameters.’ But to no avail. The Palestinians remained unimpressed.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 275 · Location 5453\nMythologies apart, Taba did not allow an agreement, not because of the fact that the Israelis’ qualitative political time was a desperately diminishing asset, but because the Palestinians treated the parameters as non-committal, and insisted on changing and challenging them on each and every point.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 276 · Location 5472\nOne needs to recall in this context that Benjamin Netanyahu came to power in 1996 amid a virulent campaign against the illegitimacy of the suicidal Oslo accords, but was eventually forced to endorse them once in office.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 277 · Location 5474\nThe weakness of the Barak government was of course due in great part to its own political blunders. But Arafat should also have wondered whether he would ever be able to reach an agreement with a ‘strong’ Israeli government when he so much excelled in weakening and eventually destroying his peace partners. Yitzhak Rabin paid with his life when he went for a dramatic breakthrough while Palestinian terrorism continued unabated, exposing him to Jewish extremists. In 1996 Shimon Peres was defeated amid an unprecedented wave of Palestinian suicide terror. And Ehud Barak suffered the greatest electoral débâcle in Israel’s political history because the voters saw the Intifada as Arafat’s counter-proposal to his peace initiative. To weaken and undermine Israeli left-wing governments, as he consistently did, and then refuse to make an agreement with them because they were ‘weak’ is a pattern that might keep the Palestinians in a permanent impasse. Ariel Sharon’s policies of scorched earth in the territories have been proof for Arafat that he who sows a wind ends by reaping a whirlwind. Arafat was a victim of his own illusions. He had a tendency to attribute to himself characteristics of a brilliant strategist and distinguished military man, ‘a general who never lost a war’, as he liked to introduce himself. But the truth is that as a strategist, of all people he proved his failure again and again. He always pushed his luck to the point where he lost all his achievements and what appeared to be a chance for reasonable victory ultimately became a disgraceful defeat. With Arafat, brinkmanship had no brakes; it was the art of bringing both his people and the Israelis to the edge of the abyss and beyond.\nHighlight(pink) - Page 277 · Location 5491\nZionism, at least up to 1948, would never have functioned this way when faced with what is always and inevitably an imperfect settlement. It always acted with its back to the wall, which is why it was blessed with the capacity for pragmatic decision making. There are two essential reasons that can explain the pragmatic wisdom of Zionism at decisive crossroads. One is the fact that, in contrast to the anti-Semitic cliché about ‘Jewish power’, Zionism was always the national movement of a weak Jewish people lacking support, a persecuted people decimated by holocaust and genocide, a people that in case of failure at the time of taking a decision might be annihilated. The Palestinians, the presumed weak side of the conflict, never acted out of lack of choice as Zionism did. Until 1948 the Zionists certainly excelled in their capacity to mobilise international support and market their case. The Palestinians, however, stumbled on every road block, avoided no mistake and displayed no savoir faire in the field of diplomacy and public relations. They always seemed to take the wrong option.\nHighlight(pink) - Page 278 · Location 5499\nAfter the Six Day War, however, the balance of forces in the war on public opinion clearly changed. Rarely–if ever–is history familiar with a similar case of a disparity between the high degree of international support enjoyed by a national movement and the poor results of such a support. In fact, after that war the overwhelming international support for the Palestinian cause almost became a handicap to the degree that it could be said that the Palestinians very nearly ‘suffered’ from an excess. At every junction of historical decision making, the international community gave them–and this is certainly true with regard to the Arab world–the sense that they were entitled to expect more and could therefore avoid a decision. The international pampering of the national Palestinian movement is unparalleled in modern history and, no less important, was at vital crossroads of the conflict an obstacle to a settlement. For it was frequently interpreted by the Palestinian leadership as an implicit encouragement to persist in its almost built-in incapacity to take decisions and find instead satisfaction in Israel’s decline into the position of a state put in the dock of the tribunal of international opinion.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 279 · Location 5519\nThe history of the Jews’ modern national movement, again mainly up until the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, had been characterised by realistic responses to objective historical conditions. The Palestinians have consistently fought for the solutions of yesterday, those they had rejected a generation or two earlier.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 280 · Location 5535\nA major reason for his incapacity to reach a reasonable compromise with Israel was precisely that the Palestinian Authority under his leadership was unwilling to develop a positive ethos of democracy, civil society, economic development and education. Instead, an old-style autocracy based on a negative ethos of confrontation was created. National cohesion was built around constituent values of radical ‘Palestinianism’, ‘refugeeism’ and Islam that left no room for compromise.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 280 · Location 5545\nPeace for Arafat, if it were to respond to vital Israeli requirements, could automatically mean a civil war. In fact, Fatah understood that particular dilemma only too well, by explicitly admitting that that was exactly the reason they had rejected the Clinton parameters. To them, as they put it when trying to explain their rejection on the organisation’s website, ‘the parameters [were] the biggest trick’ and one that meant moving the conflict from a Palestinian–Israeli dispute to ‘an internal Palestinian–Palestinian conflict that will destroy the Intifada’.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 282 · Location 5581\nThe loose control of politicians over the army is a built-in weakness and inconsistency in Israel’s political system.\nHighlight(blue) - Page 283 · Location 5596\nSharm el Sheikh international summit of early October,\nXI The Politics of Doomsday\nHighlight(pink) - Page 285 · Location 5628\nWith regard to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, the principle of compromise was now gone, the middle ground had been fatally wounded, and the so-called peace camp in Israel had been severely diminished and morally undermined by Arafat’s rejection of its peace platform.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 286 · Location 5639\nZionism’s major strategic success to date was that it forced its enemies to agree to make peace; but it could not force the terms of peace on them.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 287 · Location 5651\nSuch was the case with the invasion of Lebanon in 1982, when an entire nation followed him into an adventure that all were led to believe was inevitable, the last resort. His gamble ended by sinking Israel into a quagmire of blood, bereavement and destruction for more than eighteen years. And such was the situation when he embarked on an initiative to dismantle the settlements in the Gaza Strip that he himself had created in the first place.

The Labour Party turned its back on its own political audacity while in office and now endorsed the groundless political assumption of Ariel Sharon that the volcanic eruption of rage among the Palestinians could be calmed down by another interim settlement.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 289 · Location 5695\nAnd in any case he regarded Hamas’s violence as a major strategic tool of the Palestinian cause he would not undermine, so long as it did not directly challenge his personal rule.\nHighlight(blue) - Page 289 · Location 5698\nshelling of the Altalena,\nHighlight(orange) - Page 289 · Location 5704\nAbu-Mazen acknowledged that for an orderly Palestinian national movement to inspire vital international trust there should be, as he put it in a speech to the Palestinian parliament upon assuming the office of prime minister, ‘one authority, one law and one democratic and national decision that applies to us all’.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 290 · Location 5719\nThe government is incapable of responding to the popular yearnings for peace. For, regardless of party loyalties and according to most studies, the overwhelming majority of Israelis would support a peace settlement that is based on the Clinton parameters–two states, withdrawal from territories, massive dismantling of settlements, two capitals in Jerusalem–but they trust neither their political system nor, of course, the Palestinian leadership to come to an accommodation on that basis. Which may explain the results of a poll conducted in 2002 by the Steinmetz Centre for Peace at Tel Aviv University indicating that, convinced of the incapacity of their political system to produce solutions, 67 per cent of Israeli Jews would support an American effort to recruit an international alliance that would coax the parties into endorsing such a settlement.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 291 · Location 5733\nABC–‘Anything But Clinton’–seemed to have been President Bush’s attitude to the legacy of the Clinton administration on most domestic and international issues.

The fatal symmetry between terrorism and settlements that was born with the Oslo accords and was eventually to wreck them was the same that subverted the road map from the first moment.\nHighlight(pink) - Page 296 · Location 5839\nThe road map, just like Oslo, thus became a standing invitation for the parties to dictate the nature of the final deal through unilateral acts, such as the expansion of settlements by the Israelis and the wild campaign of suicide terrorism and armed uprising by the Palestinians.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 296 · Location 5849\nIt is inconceivable that the Palestinians would agree to repeat the experience if the parameters of the final settlement were not agreed upon in advance.\nHighlight(pink) - Page 296 · Location 5852\nA ‘temporary state’ could not, in any case, offer the popular legitimacy needed for an uncompromising war on Hamas and Islamic Jihad.

The sterilisation of the Palestinian national movement, which he has always seen as a major strategic, even existential, threat to Israel, and the confinement of a Palestinian homeland within scattered enclaves surrounded by Israeli settlements, strategic military areas and a network of bypass roads for the exclusive use of the Israeli occupier, remain, in broad lines, his grand design.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 299 · Location 5894\nFor many years Damascus has been host to a plethora of terrorist organisations from Hamas and Islamic Jihad to Hezbollah. And during the war in Iraq there were indications that not only did the Syrians facilitate the passage of Arab volunteers to Iraq, but they also transferred military equipment from their territory to Saddam’s forces. In a deliberate disregard of America’s request, Damascus refused to seal her border with Iraq.

If Bashar was doing everything to irritate the Americans, he was at the same time showing bursts of co-operation that signalled to them that he could be a valuable ally for the US in the region. In the aftermath of 9/ 11 the Syrians helped locate and even arrest key figures in Al-Qaeda. It was the Syrians who arrested Mohammed Haydar Zammar, a German citizen of Syrian descent, who had recruited Mohammed Atta, the ringleader of the 9/ 11 hijackers. The Syrians co-operated in additional ways with the American war against terror, seemingly even helping to foil an Al-Qaeda-planned attack on American forces in the Gulf. And there was, of course, also Syria’s vital vote for Security Council Resolution 1441 that allowed the US a much needed diplomatic achievement on the way to its onslaught on the Iraqi regime.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 301 · Location 5933\nThe Syrians were clearly taken aback by the way both Prime Minister Sharon and President Bush brushed aside their call for the resumption of negotiations for a settlement with Israel. There even seem to be indications, as Israel’s former military Chief of Staff General Yaalon has hinted recently, of their readiness for a deal based on the international border, rather than on the 1967 lines that Hafez al-Assad so adamantly insisted upon to the extent of making impossible a settlement with Israel.\nHighlight(orange) - Page 301 · Location 5945\nBut neither on the Palestinian front nor in the Syrian track was this philosophy being vindicated.

No one who knew his personal and political history would have imagined him delivering a speech like the one he gave on the day the Knesset approved his plan. Addressing the settlers, those whom he had spoiled and cultivated for years, he said, You have developed among you a dangerous Messianic spirit. We have no chance to survive in this part of the world that has no mercy for the weak if we persist in this path. I have learnt from my own experience that the sword alone offers no solution.

If legal action was ever brought challenging a regulation, the Court, under Chevron’s two-step analysis, was forced to give deference to the agency concerning the legality of the regulation. Now, with Chevron gone, a whole host of federal agencies can be challenged in court over statutory interpretations of their regulations, potentially leading to a lot of regulatory change.\nDecision Summary\nMajor Points of Decision\nRoberts spends the vast majority of his decision arguing that Chevron is a violation of the separation of powers, by assuming that any ambiguity in any given legislative statue is necessarily left to interpretation by an executive agency tasked with enforcing the given statue. Roberts argues it is incongruent with the construction of our three separate branches for the judiciary to give away matters of legal interpretation necessarily to executive agencies when Congress has not explicitly answered how an ambiguity should be decided.\nGorsuch writes in his opinion attacking the stare decisis defense of Chevron and details the troubled judicial history in regards to Chevron and how unworkable it was as a doctrine.\nMajor Points of the Dissent\nKagan, writing for the dissent, argues that the APA’s Section 706 does not explicitly grant the courts the ability to do de novo analysis of any ambiguous congressional statute, and instead argues that the legal and legislative environment at the time of the APA’s passage and leading up to Chevron pointed to an increase in Judicial deference to agency statutory interpretation. She also points out that all legislation that has passed since, has passed under the shadow of Chevron, and that overturning this decision will cause a major regulatory upset, something the court is supposed to avoid unless dire circumstances call for it.\nQuestions for Debates\n\nShould the government, a body that already enjoys some of the strongest prosecutorial power in the United States, also be afforded deference when making legal analysis of its own regulations?\nIf Congress so desires an agency to have wide discretion in the implementation of a particular statute, why rely on Chevron when Congress can just write that into the statute?\nIf Chevron was such a massive, ground-breaking decision, why were so few Justices even involved in the Ruling, and why did no one else seem to think so at the time?\nIf the experts in a given agency are indeed so well-studied and so well-qualified to provide substantive defense for the agencies statutory construction, then shouldn’t we expect them to be able to successfully (or even easily?) argue this in front of a judge?\nIf we believe the courts are competent enough to evaluate whether the statutory construction that an agency has undertaken is “permissible” under the second step of Chevron, wouldn’t that essentially require the Courts to have some minimum level of technical understanding? If a court is competent enough to figure out if a case would survive the second step of Chevron, why would a court not be competent enough to rule on the statutory construction in question?\nDo we want citizens of the United States to be subject to wildly different regulations, some of which may be criminal in nature, which may all qualify as “permissible interpretations” of statue, just because of changing political/bureaucratic agencies?\n\nCommentary on Opposing Points of View\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch\ncontrary opinions\n\nNotes\n\nMajority written by Chief Justice John Roberts\n\nReference to the 1984 Chevron case, citing the two-step rule process\n\nFirst, after a challenge to a particular issue of executive agency enforcement, the court must see if Congress has explicitly spoken about the issue at hand.\nSecondly, the court must then determine, if the answer is no in the first part, if the executive agency’s interpretation of Congress’s order is permissible based on the legislated statutes.\n\n\nRoberts claims that the court should be in charge of reading explicitly how a statute is intended by constructing that contention solely on their own, without any deference to executive implementation or interpretation.\n“In the business of statutory interpretation, if it is not the best, it is not permissible.”\nRoberts thinks that the court is always correct in their statutory interpretation and thus is more equipped to make determinations than the executive branch is.\nChevron step-zero is referenced - a federal court determines whether or not Congress intended for agencies or courts to possess interpretive authority over a statue.\nMaintains that the APA demands that the Courts continue to decide matters of law in regards to statutory construction.\n\n\nConcurring opinion of Justice Clarence Thomas\n\nThomas argues that Chevron compelled judges to abdicate their Article III judicial responsibility and expanded the executive power of agencies beyond their constitutional limits.\n\n\nConcurring opinion of Justice Neil Gorsuch\n\nGorsuch writes his decision to opine on the concept of stare decisis and why this ruling doesn’t violate that spirit.\nFive principles were given by Edmund Burke for evaluating past judicial decisions\n\nThere should be numerous decisions on a given topic\nThey should all reinforce one another, and not work against each other\nThey are occurring during ordinary and constitutional times\nThey aren’t tailored to a specific case\nAnd they agree generally to legal principles\n\n\nGorsuch speaks about three lessons regarding stare decisis\n\nPast decisions may rule over particular cases, but they impart no authority in future cases to depart from the Constitution or Laws of the United States.\n\nGorsuch demonstrates that older courts overruled prior decisions at an even higher rate than they do today\n\n\nPast decisions deserve respect as embodying the considered views of prior judges.\nJudges make decisions based on particular cases with arguments brought forth via particular arguments from particular parties, and should be read as such, not like a statue, that is meant to apply to all persons in all situations.\n\n\nGorsuch talks about how Chevron violates these three lessons\n\nChevron deference violates the APA\n\nJudges abdicate a large measure of their judicial responsibilities to agencies, the latter of whom may end up disagreeing with themselves or other judicial rules about their federal regulations.\nPoints out that Chevron didn’t even bother to cite the APA.\n\n\nChevron deference runs in opposition to the majority thoughts of lawyers, present and past.\n\nChevron violated the controlling opinion from Skidmore, and represented a departure from prior understandings of judicial control regarding statutory construction that was at ends with judicial history.\n\n\nChevron’s deference finds too much power in in dicta statements.\n\n\nGorsuch argues that the independence of Judges is built into the Constitution to shield interpretation of the law from political pressures. However, Chevron deference allows for highly politically influenced actors to determine what a valid legal interpretation of a statute might be.\nChevron also favors the federal government, already the most powerful litigant, and guarantees a systematic bias favoring political partisanship.\nChevron ensured that laws essentially changed on the whim of elected bureaucrats.\nChevron has made the law ambiguous and susceptible to changing administrations, rather than changing laws.\nGorsuch claims Chevron is unworkable for a variety of reasons.\n\nThe Federal government is not even sure when it applies.\nPrior judges don’t always apply different intermediate Chevron steps.\n“Step-zero” lol\nDifferent judges (reasonable minds) apparently disagree on when different stages of Chevron even apply.\n\n\nGorsuch points out the variety of Chevron applications coming from even just the two cases before the Court.\nHe also reminds the reader that “reasonable” interpretations can change, effectively changing the law at the whim of the executive without a change in the law itself.\nGorsuch brings up a case where Brand X had to endure a rule change 4 times under 4 different administrations.\nRegulatory capture for regulation changes can happen more easily under Chevron deference.\nGorsuch criticizes wielders of Chevron for including a simple statement about “permissible construction” and pretending as though that represented a significant departure from prior statutory construction and judicial review of said construction. He also notes this was a bare quorum decision, without a concurrent or dissenting opinion offered.\nIn the 19 argued cases in the following term, Chevron was cited a single time.\nGorsuch argued that Scalia’s goal in launching Chevron was to remedy the US of the “creative” readings the Court might have of particular federal laws, and bring some stability to the interpretations by granting deference to agencies, due to the judicial environment of “freer” legal interpretation that existed at the time. Scalia would later walk back his Chevron opinion, believing that the courts should have become more restrained, not that the legal review should have been given deference to the agencies.\nStates have refused to incorporate Chevron deference in their own systems.\nThe Court has made rulings on highly technical cases since 2016 without the need to invoke Chevron.\n\n\nOpinion of Justice Elena Kagan, with whom Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson join, in dissent\n\nKagan argues that ambiguity is a feature of the legislature, not a defect to be solved by the courts.\nKagan argues that Section 706 is silent on the standard for reviewing an agency’s statutory construction, arguing that the activity of Congress since then and at the same of the APA’s passage indicates that a deferential standard was preferable.\nKagan argues that Chevron was entitled to strong stare decisis protections.\nKagan argues that the “jolt” to the system is another good stare decisis argument, because Congress has passed laws under a Chevron two-step assumption.\n\n\n\nQuestions for me to Research\n\nWhat does the APA specifically call for?\n"},"Research/Legal/United-States/US-Supreme-Court/Trump-v.-United-States-(23-939)/Notes":{"title":"Notes","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Relevance\nDecision Summary\nMajor Points of Decision\nChief Justice John Roberts, writing the majority opinion, argues that the president has three different types of actions he can take, and then creates a novel ruling about the types of criminal immunity that would apply to the president, based on the kind of action.\n\n“Core powers” actions are “conclusive and preclusive” actions that only the executive (president) can perform.\n\nAny action taken here is granted absolute immunity. These actions are not only beyond judicial review, none of these acts are able to be cited or referenced in any other criminal matter as evidence or otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Chief Justice John Roberts, pages 8-9 \n                  \n                \n\nCongress cannot act on, and courts cannot examine, the President’s actions on subjects within his “conclusive and preclusive” constitutional authority. It follows that an Act of Congress—either a specific one targeted at the President or a generally applicable one—may not criminalize the President’s actions within his exclusive constitutional power. Neither may the courts adjudicate a criminal pros- ecution that examines such Presidential actions. We thus conclude that the President is absolutely immune from criminal prosecution for conduct within his exclusive sphere of constitutional authority.\n\n\n\n“Official acts” are actions that the president takes up to the “outer perimeter” of his role as long as it “relates to the effective discharge of a President’s powers.”\n\nAny action taken here are granted presumptive immunity, in order to protect the president’s ability “to execute the duties of his office fearlessly and fairly.” This means that the burden is on “the Government [to argue] that applying a criminal prohibition to that act would pose no “dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.””\n\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Chief Justice John Roberts, page 20 \n                  \n                \n\nSimilarly, when a subpoena issued to President Nixon to produce certain tape recordings and documents relating to his conversations with aides and advisers, this Court re- jected his claim of “absolute privilege,” given the “constitutional duty of the Judicial Branch to do justice in criminal prosecutions.” But we simultaneously recognized “the public interest in candid, objective, and even blunt or harsh opinions in Presidential decision-making,” as well as the need to protect “communications between high Government officials and those who advise and assist them in the performance of their manifold duties.” Because the President’s “need for complete candor and objectivity from advisers calls for great deference from the courts,” we held that a “presumptive privilege” protects Presidential communications. That privilege, we explained, “relates to the effective discharge of a President’s powers.” We thus deemed it “fundamental to the operation of Government and inextricably rooted in the separation of powers under the Constitution.”\n\n\n\n“Unofficial acts” are actions that the president takes as a private citizen.\n\n“As for a President’s unofficial acts, there is no immunity.”\nRoberts notes that “in dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President’s motives. Such an inquiry would risk exposing even the most obvious instances of official conduct to judicial examination on the mere allegation of improper purpose, thereby intruding on the Article II interests that immunity seeks to protect.”\n\n\n\nRoberts explicitly references four different sections of conduct in the allegations, and treats them as such:\n\nConversations between Trump and his Acting Attorney General with regards to sending letters to states about “sham” investigations.\n\nConversations between Trump and his Attorney General are “readily categorized” as being “conclusive and preclusive” to the executive, and therefor any of those conversations would be “absolutely immune from prosecution.”\n\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Chief Justice John Roberts, page 28 \n                  \n                \n\nInvestigative and prosecutorial decision-making is “the special province of the Executive Branch,” and the Constitution vests the entirety of the executive power in the President. For that reason, Trump’s threatened removal of the Acting Attorney General likewise implicates “conclusive and preclusive” Presidential authority. As we have explained, the President’s power to remove “executive officers of the United States whom he has appointed” may not be regulated by Congress or reviewed by the courts. The President’s “management of the Executive Branch” requires him to have “unrestricted power to remove the most important of his subordinates”—such as the Attorney General—“in their most important duties.”\n\n\n\nConversations between Trump and Pence with regards to counting the electoral votes.\n\nThe Court granted presumptive immunity to these actions and remanded this part of the indictment to the lower courts to determine “whether a prosecution involving Trump’s alleged attempts to influence the Vice President’s oversight of the certification proceeding in his capacity as President of the Senate would pose any dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.”\n\n\nCommunications with state officials with regards to their electors.\n\nThis section of the indictment was remanded to the District Court to do a fact analysis to determine if these actions were official or unofficial.\n\n\nTrump’s speech made and actions taken on January 6th during the insurrection.\n\nThis section of the indictment was remanded to the District Court to do a fact analysis to determine if these actions were official or unofficial.\n\n\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett writes a concurrent opinion in which she agrees with the core of Roberts’ argument, but she says that the majority takes an overly broad view of official conduct and has no good rationale in preventing even absolutely immune actions from being used to investigate other criminal acts.\nMajor Points of the Dissent\nSonia Sotomayor, with whom Elena Kagan and Kentaji Jackson join, dissenting, writes that the immunity is legally and historically inconsistent. She believes that the Court has gone even further than what Trump’s lawyers were even asking for, as Trump’s lawyers seemed to concede that a lot of the conduct was unofficial and that the President might be criminally charged for actions, even if they were official and core powers, so long as he were impeached and convicted first, two things that Roberts rejected in his majority opinion.\nSotomayor also points out that there are many federal safeguards in place for criminal prosecution, and that Roberts has failed to engage whatsoever with the idea that the public might have a public interest in having a president who does not feel as though he has any criminal liability while performing his duties. If the bias were so strong that the president could never have a fair trial over official conduct, it seems reasonable to believe that this would apply to literally any potential trial involving him, defeating the need for any sort of absolute immunity over only certain actions anyway.\nShe also remarks that it was not right for Roberts to make a determination of absolute immunity for the conversations between Donald Trump and his Attorney General, while remanding every single other action back to the District Court.\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson, dissenting, writes that, while Roberts expresses great concern about the “separation of powers,” he has “snatched” a huge amount of power for the Court, as the Court is now the sole determining factor in whether or not certain conduct is entitled to absolute immunity from any sort of judicial review.\nNotes\n\nChief Justice John Roberts, writing the majority opinion\n\nThe president has three broad types of immunity claims\n\n“Core powers” that only the executive/president can perform.\n\nActions taken here are granted absolute immunity.\n\n\n“Official powers” or “Overlapping powers” where the president OR some other branch could perform them.\n\nActions taken here are given presumptive immunity, meaning the burden is on the Government to prove that immunity should not be granted in this particular case, by proving that prosecuting a particular presidential act must pose “no dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.”\n\n\n“Unofficial” actions\n\nActions taken here are granted no criminal immunity, Roberts says that these actions must be “manifestly or palpably beyond [their] authority.”\n\n\n\n\nAny immunity granted for any actions also means those actions cannot be reviewed even if they were used in the furtherance of another crime.\nRulings on 4 major allegations brought up in the Opinion\n\nConversation between Trump and his Attorney General\n\nThe SC said this would be granted absolute immunity\n\n\nPressuring Pence to flip the electoral vote.\n\nGranted presumptive immunity\n\n\nConversations with state officials to flip their electoral votes.\n\nRemanded to the lower courts to argue about what kind of actions these were.\n\n\nSpeech made on January 6th to rally supporters to march on the capitol\n\nRemanded to the lower courts to argue about what kind of actions these were\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClarence Thomas, concurring\n\nArgues there is no ability for the Special Counsel to exist\n\n\nAmy Coney Barrett, concurring in part\n\nBarrett disagrees that official acts can’t be probed or presented as evidence in a criminal trial, even if those particular acts would ordinarily be immune from criminal prosecution.\nBarrett also doesn’t seem to agree with an “expansive” view on the absolute immunity argument forwarded by Roberts, but instead seems to view “official conduct” with a much more narrow lens, citing the conversations Trump has with election officials as falling squarely into private conduct, whereas Roberts remanded those questions to the lower courts.\n\n\nSonia Sotomayor, with whom Elena Kagan and Kentaji Jackson join, dissenting\n\nSotomayor argues in five parts\n\nThat the immunity is legally and historically inconsistent\n\nSome state constitution actually did provide for criminal immunity for sitting governors, this was not included in the US Constitution.\nArt I §3 C7 gives us the “nevertheless” for criminal prosecution, and things like bribery are official acts for which one can be impeached, so any citations of this part of the Constitution seem to imply that criminalizing official conduct was textually supported by the Constitution.\nSotomayor makes reference to other historical arguments that support the criminal charging of public officials acting in their official capacity.\n\n\nThat it is “deeply wrong”\nThat the “core” immunity is misguided and not needed\n\nThe difference between an official and unofficial act and the inability to probe motives or intents of anything that can be even slightly construed as an official act essentially nullifies almost all criminal law from applying to almost all presidential actions.\nThe civil vs criminal balancing test is not appropriately applied, since the public has a greater interest in criminal prosecution than it does in private suits, the executive branch should need to provide a greater reason, not a lesser one, to evade such liability.\n\n\nThe evidentiary holding is unprecedented\nAnd that the ruling will have disastrous consequences\n\n\nThere are many more safeguards and protections built into criminal suits vs private action.\nThe court, even though it rejected Trump’s arguments that impeachment must precede any criminal indictment, actually grants more immunity by claiming even actions by which a president is impeached for cannot be criminal charged.\nSotomayor challenges the logic that juries might be biased against a president’s “official-acts” due to their bias against their administration, however, that same logic would likely extend to literally every single act of a president, including non-official acts for other private suits.\nRoberts remanded 3 actions back to the lower courts for analysis, but for some reason thought it appropriate to declare the conversations Trump had with the AG as qualifying for absolute immunity with zero lower court consideration or analysis first.\nShe points out that Roberts goes further than what the defendants were even asking for, noting that even when they’ve conceded some acts as private, Roberts is saying they may not be.\n\n\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson, dissenting\n\nJackson points out the ludicrousness of the majority calling this a “Separation of Powers” question.\nSays that majority claims that the president must commit crimes in order to do his job.\nShe points out that the Judges and Prosecutors themselves must assume a role of quasi-jury, judging whether a particular action was official or criminal in nature before any trial has even begun.\nThis ruling has allowed the court to snatch power from the Legislature and give it to the Court and the Executive, as they are now making determinations of who the law applies to.\n“Core powers” aren’t even very well defined in the Constitution.\n\n\n\nQuestions for me to Research\n\nWhat are core powers of the president?\nWhat is the difference between absolute vs qualified immunity.\nYoungstown Sheet &amp; Tube v. Sawyer court case grants the president some actions that are not reviewable\nNixon v. Fitzgerald - what kind of presidential immunities and privileges was the Court talking about in this case?\nUnited States v Nixon 418 U.S. 683, 703, 711; what is “presumptive privilege” relating to presidential communications?\nNixon v Fitzgerald 457 US at 754, pp12-15 - Government needs to show that applying a criminal prohibition to an act would pose no danger of intrusion on the presidential powers.\nNixon 418 U.S. at 693 about “exclusive authority and absolute discretion” to decide which crimes to investigate and prosecute\nTrump v Hawaii 585 US 667, 701, does the president speaking constitute a core power?\nUnited States v Burr about compelling a president to turn over evidence for a subpoena.\n\nQuestions for Debates\n\nCan you give a single example of an action a president might want to take that would be chilled by him being criminally liable, even for the core functions of his office?\nIf we are so worried about presidents infinitely prosecuting prior presidents for criminal matters, why has it not happened yet?\nWhy did Ford find it necessary to pardon Nixon, and why did Nixon accept the pardon, if the President was assumed immune from criminal prosecution for acts taken as president?\nLet’s say a president goes on TV and makes a statement that a particular judicial action would deter him from making tough decisions about running the United States. Would this statement in and of itself not shield him from all criminal prosecution with respect to the criminal action he references, as it could be cited by the Court itself as evidence that the proposed judicial action would intrude  “on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.”\nWould you be okay with the entire cases against Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton falling under the purview of “official acts” in accordance with this ruling, thereby making all of their actions absolutely immune from criminal prosecution or judicial review?\n\nCommentary on Opposing Points of View\n\nx.com/theramblingfool/status/1807815228173799619\nwww.youtube.com/watch\n"},"Research/Library/Events/1901-1925---Sursock-Purchases":{"title":"1901-1925 - Sursock Purchases","links":["Research/Library/Governments/Palestine-Jewish-Colonization-Association","Research/Library/Governments/Palestine-Land-Development-Company","Research/Library/Governments/Jewish-National-Fund","Research/Library/Geographics/Mandate-for-Palestine","Research/Library/Geographics/Jezreel-Valley","Research/Library/Geographics/Haifa-Bay"],"tags":[],"content":"Sources\n\n“Sursock Purchases” Wikipedia.

The Arab Revolt had, of course, an understandable rationale behind it, namely, to force Britain to reverse her policies in favour of the National Home for the Jews, stop immigration and curtail the land acquisition by the Zionists. But the method and the evolution of the Revolt reflected rage and blind despair more than organisation or careful strategy. The result would be a resounding defeat for the Palestinian Arabs that would bring them to the ultimate débâcle of 1948 in a state of fatalistic disarray. The years between the Arab Revolt and the Naqbah of 1948 witnessed the dismemberment of the Palestinian community and the loss of their political autonomy to the extent that when they had to face the challenge of partition and war in 1947–8, they were no longer the masters of their own destiny. By then their cause would be usurped by the neighbouring Arab states. It was not until the emergence of the Fatah movement and Yasser Arafat’s PLO in the mid 1960s that the Palestinians recovered the control of their own cause.\n\n\n\nSecond phase in 1937 lead to violent conflict between British Army and Palestine Police Force against the peasant-led resistance movement.\n\nOutcome\n\nWalid Khalidi estimates 19,792 casualties for the Arabs, with 5,032 dead, 3,832 killed by the British and 1,200 dead due to intracommunal terrorism, and 14,760 wounded.

(p. 34)\n                  \n                \n\nThe paradox of the winter of 1947 was that the Jews, who accepted Resolution 181–the Jewish public acclaimed its endorsement by the UN with genuine outbursts of jubilation–were ready and well deployed to face a war should this be the outcome, and the Arabs, who rejected the Resolution out of hand and made no secret of their intention to subvert it, were not at all prepared for war. Ben-Gurion, who upon his appointment as the ‘defence minister’ of the Jewish Agency in 1946 made it clear that the time had now arrived for ‘a showdown of force, a Jewish military showdown’, had been for some time meticulously preparing for a war he was convinced, at least ever since the Arab Revolt, was inevitable. The Palestinians, who on 1 December 1947 made their views clear when the Arab Higher Committee declared a general strike, were totally unprepared and poorly equipped for an armed conflict. Arab society had been crumbling from within ever since the brutal repression of the 1936–9 Revolt. Leaderless and decapitated of their traditional elites, deeply fragmented, respectful and frightened of the Yishuv’s military power, and disorientated as to their real or achievable objectives, the Palestinians approached the imminent conflict and, as it turned out, their second catastrophe in a decade, in a state of disarray and fatalistic despair.\n\n\n\nIsrael declares independence at Tel Aviv on May 14th, 1948.\nWar had two main phases, the first began on November 30th, 1947.\n\nFirst phase mainly fought between Jewish and Palestinian Arab militias, supported by the Arab Liberation Army and the surrounding Arab states. Escalated at the end of March 1948, when Jews went on the offensive.\n\n\nAfter Arabs fled Haifa, Jaffa and Jerusalem, the US pulled out of the Partition Plan while the British supported the annexation of the Arab part of Palestine by Transjordan.\nFunds raised by Golda Meir and Stalin’s support allowed Israel to purchase weapons from Eastern Europe, namely Czechoslovakia.\nMay 14th, 1948, the last British troops and personnel departed Haifa, and the Jewish leadership declared the establishment of the state of Israel.\nSecond phase of the war began in May of 1948, the Arab-Israeli War, when invasion happens after Jewish leadership declares independence.\n\nInvading countries were Egypt, Iraq, Transjordan and Syria, supported by the Arab Liberation Army and corps of volunteers from Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and Yemen\n\n\nPlan Dalet\n\nForced expulsion and control of areas that extended beyond the proposed partition borders. Some (Zionists) claim that this was a defensive action to secure the future safety and borders of the new country, Israel, others claim this was purely an offensive territorial conquest aimed to ethnically cleanse the surrounding lands of Arabs to make it fertile for future Jews to settle.\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nIn 1949, Israel signed separate Armistice agreements with Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria to establish these temporary military borders.\n\nEgypt occupied the Gaza Strip and had a demilitarized zone around ‘Uja al-Hafeer.\nLebanon agreed to international boundary between Lebanon and Mandatory Palestine.\nJordanian forces remained in East Jerusalem and other positions held by them.\n\nAlso allowed to take over positions previously held by Iraqi forces.\n\n\nSyria maintained 66 square kilometers in the Jordan Valley, designated as DMZs.\nIraq had no formal agreement as they withdrew their forces.\nThe new military borders, as set by the agreements, encompassed about 78% of Mandatory Palestine.\n\n\nOver 700,000 displaced Palestinians that fled or were expelled from their land as a result.\nOver 700,000 Jews exodus from Arab and Muslim lands in the 3 years following the war, fleeing into Israel.\nEstablished Israel as an independent state (founded by David Ben-Gurion), recognized immediately by Truman (U.S.) and Stalin (USSR).\n\nImportant Notes\n\nKnown to Israel as the War of Independence, and to the Palestinians as al-Nakba.\n"},"Research/Library/Events/1947.11.29---The-United-Nations-Partition-Plan-for-Palestine,-or-Resolution-(II)":{"title":"1947.11.29 - The United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, or Resolution (II)","links":["Research/Library/Governments/United-Nations"],"tags":[],"content":"Sources\n\n”United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine“ Wikipedia.

As it turned out, the annexation of the West Bank extended the borders of the Hashemite kingdom but, by Palestinising the kingdom and shifting the emphasis of Jordanian politics to a pan-Arab sensibility towards the plight of the Palestinians, it diminished the King’s power and capacity to continue being the undisputed autocratic leader he had been thus far. On 17 February 1950 the King made a last-ditch attempt to salvage something from the wreckage of his peace strategy with Israel by proposing a non-aggression pact. This was a brilliant move, for it could unleash a dynamic leading to a possible peace deal in the future. It also implicitly meant Israel’s recognition of Jordan’s annexation of the West Bank. The agreement could likewise allow Israel to claim her first political breakthrough with an Arab state and a crack in the Arab economic boycott. There were even some provisions in Abdullah’s proposal that could satisfy the Palestinians by opening judicial channels for refugees to reclaim their abandoned property in Israel. The Israeli Cabinet ratified the agreement at its meeting of 22 February, with Foreign Minister Sharett praising the ‘psychological’ importance of the document. But it was again the Jordanians, not the Israelis, who failed to deliver. Abu al-Huda’s government got cold feet and unilaterally changed both the title and the content of the agreement. It was now becoming clear that the Palestinisation of the kingdom and the rift between the King and a no longer docile political class had emerged as an insurmountable obstacle to an Israeli–Jordanian settlement, however modest its provisions. Abdullah could not allow himself the political luxury of being exposed as a yielding king in conflict with a patriotic pan-Arab government.\n\n\nOutcome\nImportant Notes"},"Research/Library/Events/1949.04.27-1949.09.12---Lausanne-Conference-of-1949":{"title":"1949.04.27-1949.09.12 - Lausanne Conference of 1949","links":["Research/Library/Governments/United-Nations-Conciliation-Commission-for-Palestine","Research/Library/Geographics/Israel","Research/Library/Geographics/Egypt","Research/Library/Geographics/Jordan","Research/Library/Geographics/Lebanon","Research/Library/Geographics/Syria","Research/Library/Governments/Arab-Higher-Committee","Research/Library/Geographics/Lausanne"],"tags":[],"content":"Sources\n\nBen-Ami, Shlomo.

But this was out of the question in a historical and political context, where a clash existed between an emergent Jewish state and its defeated enemies, for whom the repatriation of refugees was one way of hampering the growth and development of the newborn, yet intimidating, state against which they harboured understandable intentions of revanche. At the Lausanne Peace Conference Israel eventually agreed to the repatriation of 100,000 Palestinian refugees, but this was almost by force of habit rejected out of hand by the Arabs as too little. Too little it might have been, but Israel made the offer only with the hope of getting relief from American pressure.

Worried that trade would be interrupted, Britain and France approached Israel, who was worried that the anti-Zionist Egypt was amassing a massive military, to devise a covert plan, the Protocol of Sèvres, in order to stage an Israeli military invasion that would be disrupted by Anglo-Franco forces, which would then give way to an international ownership of the Suez Canal. Despite military success by all three parties, intense international pressure, especially from the United States, pressure from revolting colonies, and intense domestic pressure at home, combined with nuclear sabre-rattling from the USSR, forced the Anglo-Franco forces to immediately withdraw, suffering an international humiliation. Israel would withdraw its forces sometime later, having re-established trade through the Straights of Tiran. Egypt, and namely, Nasser, would emerge feeling as though they had single-handedly defied European imperialistic aims, and saw itself as an emerging unaligned leader of the Arab World.\n\n\n\nImportant Notes"},"Research/Library/Events/1964.01.13-1964.01.16---1964-Arab-League-summit":{"title":"1964.01.13-1964.01.16 - 1964 Arab League summit","links":["Research/Library/Governments/Arab-League","Research/Library/Geographics/Egypt","Research/Library/Geographics/Iraq","Research/Library/Geographics/Lebanon","Research/Library/Geographics/Palestine","Research/Library/Geographics/Syria","Research/Library/Geographics/Saudi-Arabia","Research/Library/Geographics/Jordan","Research/Library/Geographics/Yemen","Research/Library/Geographics/Libya","Research/Library/Geographics/Sudan","Research/Library/Geographics/Morocco","Research/Library/Geographics/Tunisia","Research/Library/Geographics/Kuwait","Research/Library/Geographics/Algeria","Research/Library/Geographics/Cairo"],"tags":[],"content":"Sources\n\nBen-Ami, Shlomo.

The nuclear option could also be seen as a protest against, or an alternative to, America’s reluctance to accord solid and unequivocal conventional guarantees to Israel’s existence and incorporate it into an organic regional alliance. Indeed, there were those in the Israeli political system who wanted to use the Dimona nuclear reactor as a way of pressuring America into securing Israel’s conventional capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo.

He bombarded world leaders with dramatic appeals for an international commitment to the independence and territorial integrity of all the states in the Middle East. Whatever territorial dreams he might have harboured in the past, he was now a keen champion of the status quo. To him, the territorial phase of Zionism was over and the safety of Israel within the borders of 1949 was his exclusive concern. Only the full demilitarisation of the West Bank and a formal defence treaty with America could set his mind at rest.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo.

In his case it was the very existence of his kingdom that was at stake. He did not want to be dragged into war, but was too weak to resist the tide. As much as the supposed threat posed by Israel, it was actually the pressure of Fatah and the PLO that put in jeopardy the stability of the Hashemite kingdom. For the PLO, liberating Palestine also meant overthrowing the Hashemites’ ‘colonialist rule’. The King harboured no illusions as to the ultimate rationale of the PLO’s presence in Jordan, namely, as he explicitly wrote to Nasser, ‘the destruction of Jordan’.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo.

In December 1966 he wrote to General Zvi Zamir, Israel’s military attaché in London: ‘an escalation with Syria is not against Israel’s interest, and in my view there is no better time than now for a confrontation with Syria.

After hearing about the impending UN ceasefire, he changed his mind and captured it.\n“Fearful that Israeli soldiers would exact retribution for the 1929 massacre of the city’s Jewish community, Hebron’s residents flew white sheets from their windows and rooftops.&quot;&quot;\nSyria entered the war on the assumption that Israel was losing dramatically to Egyptian forces. Nasser exaggerated/lied about Egyptian victory.\nDayan, after hearing of the Syrian acceptance of a cease-fire, clears an invasion/occupation on his own into the Golan Heights.\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nConclusion\n\nIsrael seizes the Gaza Strip and the Sinai Peninsula (from Egypt), the West Bank of the Jordan River, including East Jerusalem (from Jordan), and the Golan Heights (from Syria).\n1967 Palestinian exodus.\n\n280k-325k Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, mostly resettled in Jordan, the other 700k remained.\n100k fled in the Golan Heights.\nIsrael granted full citizenship only to those in East Jerusalem (1967) and the Golan Heights (1981). Most Palestinians in territories declined to take citizenship.\n\n\nJews immigrating en masse out of the Soviet Union, and Jews leaving en masse from Arab countries (continued from 1948), and Jews leaving en masse from other Communist countries.\n\n\n\nImportant Notes"},"Research/Library/Events/1967.06.08---USS-Liberty-Incident":{"title":"1967.06.08 - USS Liberty Incident","links":["Research/Library/Geographics/United-States","Research/Library/Geographics/Israel","Research/Library/Geographics/Mediterranean-Sea","Research/Library/Geographics/Sinai-Peninsula"],"tags":[],"content":"Sources\n\n“USS Liberty incident.” Wikipedia.

The constructive ambiguity of the November 1967 Security Council Resolution Number 242, which called for peace based on the restitution of ‘territories’ instead of ‘the territories’, allowed Israel to claim that the borders would have to be modified on all fronts as a condition for peace and gave manoeuvring space to her post-war diplomacy. Resolution 242 was the result of the need to find a formula that would reconcile Israel’s unrealistic expectation to have full peace for less than all the territories, and the Arabs’ drive for a full restitution of land in exchange for a watered-down state of non-belligerency.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo.

The PLO’s outright rejection of 242 was an additional manifestation by the Palestinians that their struggle would from now on be independent of the Arabs’ diplomatic strategy. The Palestinians were about to disengage from the status of a tool in the hands of the Arab states to that of an independent subject in the history of the Middle East. As from the Palestinian débâcle of 1936–9 and later the 1948 Naqbah, the Palestinians had lost their independence as a national movement. They disappeared from the regional arena as autonomous players. The 1967 war, the defeat of the Arab armies with their consequent loss of a credible military option in the foreseeable future, and the relegation by Resolution 242 of the Palestinian problem to the margins of peacemaking in the region, signalled the beginning of a new phase in the history of Palestinian nationalism.\n\n\nOutcome\nImportant Notes\n\nThe ambiguity of 242 is intentional and allowed Israel to claim they needn’t give back “all” of the occupied territories, just some of them, in order to fulfil their obligations under this Resolution.\nThe Palestinians felt excluded from the language of this Resolution, leading to their outright rejection of 242.\n"},"Research/Library/Events/1968.03.21---The-Battle-of-Karameh":{"title":"1968.03.21 - The Battle of Karameh","links":["Research/Library/Geographics/Israel","Research/Library/People/Levi-Eshkol","Research/Library/People/Moshe-Dayan","Research/Library/Geographics/Jordan","Research/Library/People/Hussein","Research/Library/Governments/Palestine-Liberation-Organization","Research/Library/People/Yasser-Arafat","Research/Library/Events/1970.10.01-1971.07.23---Black-September,-or-the-Jordanian-Civil-War"],"tags":[],"content":"Sources\n\n“Battle of Karameh” Wikipedia.

These were mostly blocked by the IDF, but sometimes the JAF artillery would give Fatah squads covering fire, leading to frequent direct skirmishes between the IDF and the Jordanian Army.\nOn February 14th-15th, Jordanian mortars hit several Israeli settlements in the Beit Shean Valley and the Jordan Valley. Israeli artillery and air forces retaliated, causing thousands of Jordanian farmers to flee eastward, being replaced by fedayeen coming west. King Hussein declared he would prevent these groups from using Jordan as a base for attack.\nIn February, King Hussein sent 20 carloads of troops to Karameh, but they were turned back by Fatah fighters.\nBy March, several hundred civilians and 900 guerrillas, along with Yasser Arafat, lived in the camp.\nInitially the attack on the camp was not getting approved. Moshe Dayan warned that a bus may strike a mine, and on March 18th, one did. The next day, an operation was scheduled.\n\n2 adults were killed and 10 children were wounded by a mine near Be’er Ora in the Arava.\nThis was the 38th Fatah operation in about 3 months.\n\n\nThe IAF dropped leaflets telling the Jordanian army that Israel did not want to fight, but the leaflets went unheeded.\nThe fedayeen had been warned in advance by Egyptian intelligence, and most of the 2,000 Arab commandos living Karameh went into the surrounding hills to snipe.\n\nEvents\n\n15 hour military engagement between the IDF and the PLO/JAF (Palestine Liberation Organization, and the Jordanian Armed Forces)\nFedayeen moved bases into Jordan and stepped up attacks on Israel/the West Bank after the Six Day War.\nIsrael wanted to capture Arafat and destroy the border town of Karameh. They also wanted to punish Jordan for their perceived support to the fedayeen.\n\nOutcome\n\nIsrael retreated after the JAF returned artillery fire on the invading IDF forces; most of the camp was destroyed and 140 PLO members were captured.\nIsrael claimed victory for destroying the camp, but the PLO and Jordan claimed victory for killing 3 IDF soldiers and damaging several Israeli vehicles/tanks.\nThis engagement marked the first known deployment of suicide bombers by Palestinian fighters.\nThe UNSC issued Resolution 248, condemning Israel for violating the cease-fire line and its disproportionate use of force.\nKing Hussein initially supported and  allowed the PLO to take credit for the military operation, but the growth of their strength caused them to speak openly of overthrowing the Hashemite monarchy.\nFatah reported that 5,000 volunteers applied to join within 48 hours of the battle.\n\nBy late March, there were nearly 20,000 fedayeen in Jordan.\n\n\nIraq and Syria offered raining programs for several thousand guerrillas.\nThe Gulf states, led by Kuwait, raised money for them through a 5% tax on Palestinian resident workers, and a fund drive in Lebanon raised $500,000 from Beirut alone.\nWithin a year of the battle, Fatah had branches in about 80 countries.\nThis battle and the subsequent increase in the PLO’s strength is a major catalyst for The Jordanian Civil War.\n\nImportant Notes"},"Research/Library/Events/1970.10.01-1971.07.23---Black-September,-or-the-Jordanian-Civil-War":{"title":"1970.10.01-1971.07.23 - Black September, or the Jordanian Civil War","links":["Research/Library/Governments/Palestine-Liberation-Organization","Research/Library/People/Yasser-Arafat","Research/Library/Governments/Fatah","Research/Library/Governments/Popular-Front-for-the-Liberation-of-Palestine","Research/Library/Governments/Democratic-Front-for-the-Liberation-of-Palestine","Research/Library/Geographics/Syria","Research/Library/Militaries/Palestine-Liberation-Army","Research/Library/Militaries/Organization-of-Iranian-People’s-Fedai-Guerrillas","Research/Library/Militaries/People’s-Mojahedin-Organization-of-Iran","Research/Library/Geographics/Jordan","Research/Library/People/Hussein"],"tags":[],"content":"Sources\n\nAuthor last name, first name. “Page Title.” Website Name. Month Day, Year. URL.\n\nBelligerents\n\nPLO\n\nNotable Leaders\n\nYasser Arafat\n\n\n15,000 - 40,000 troops\nFatah\nPFLP\nDFLP\n\n\nSyria (until November 1970)\n\n10,000 troops, 300 tanks\nPLA\n\n\nOIPFG\nMEK\n\n\n\nJordan\n\nNotable Leaders\n\nKing Hussein\n\n\n65,000 - 74,000 troops\n\n\n\nCasualties and losses\n\nPLO\n\n3,400 killed\n\n\nSyria\n\n600 casualties\n120 tanks and APCs lost\n\n\n\n\n\nJordan\n\n537 killed\n\n\n\nLocation\n\nJordan\n\nCauses\n\nBackground\n\nJordan’s population right now consisted 2/3rds of Palestinians, and only 1/3rd of Jordanians. Nasser’s political support also strengthened the Palestinians position.\nPalestinian fedayeen enclaves in Jordan began to set up “independent republics” where they attempted to set up checkpoints and tax citizens.\nIn September of 1970, members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine hijacked four airliners bound for New York City and one for London. Explosives were used to destroy the empty planes for the press.\nKing Hussein saw this as the last straw, and threat to his rule, and decided to take action against the PLO presence in Jordan.\nBy 1970, different factions within the PLO called for the overthrow of Jordan’s king, Hussein.\nHussein attempted to appease the fedayeen with an edict, and with the support of Nasser, though this failed and the fedayeen continued to grow in opposition. Libya, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait openly supported the fedayeen.\nIsrael guaranteed Jordan that they would not push territorial boundaries if Jordan withdraw troops from the border for a PLO confrontation.\nOn the 7th of June, Hussein’s motorcade came under heavy fire by fedayeen soldiers while attempting to visit the mukhabarat headquarters.\nA ceasefire was attempted to be called after retaliation, though the PFLP did not abide by it and instead held 68 foreign nationals hostage in two Amman hotels, threatening to blow them up if Jordan did not dismiss their Special Forces and some military leaders.\nBy August, Arafat seemed to have wanted to stage a revolution in Jordan.\nThe PFLP began hijacking planes to bring attention to the Palestinian problem.\n\n\n\nEvents\n\nIn September, Hussein begins to capture his capital and attempts to push the fedayeen out of Jordanian cities and refugee camps.\n\nSyrian forces, 10,000 strong, with PLA markings marched towards Irbid to support the fedayeen.\n17,000 Iraqi troops remained in Jordan after the 6-day war, causing concern that they may intervene.\n\n\nThe US stationed a navy fleet to be positioned off the coast of Israel, near Jordan.\nIsrael mobilized troops to begin to support Jordan, readying its air force to discourage Syrian troops with sonic booms.\nArafat and Hussein signed a peace deal on the 27th of September, brokered by Nasser.\nIranian leftist guerilla organizations sided with the PLO during the conflict, bombing the Jordanian embassy in Tehran during King Hussein’s state visit in revenge of the events of Black September.\n\nOutcome\n\nJordan allowed the fedayeen to relocate to Lebanon via Syria, where four years later they would become involved in the Lebanese Civil War.\n\nThe Palestinian Black September Organization was founded afterwards to punish Jordan for its expulsion, resulting in the assassination of Jordanian prime minister Wasfi Tal in 1971 due to his command of the military during operations against the fedayeen.\n\nThis organization also carried out a terrorist attack during the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany, with 8 members killing 11 Israeli coaches and athletes, as well as 1 West German police officer.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1972, the 3 surviving PLO terrorists from the Munich massacre were traded in exchange of the hostages taken on the hijacking of Lufthansa Flight 615.\n\nImportant Notes"},"Research/Library/Events/1973.10-1974.03---1973-oil-crisis":{"title":"1973.10-1974.03 - 1973 oil crisis","links":["Research/Library/Governments/Organization-of-Arab-Petroleum-Exporting-Countries"],"tags":[],"content":"Sources\n\n“1973 oil crisis.” Wikipedia.

The Soviets began supplying arms to Egypt and Syria while the US then resumed supplying arms to Israel.\nIsrael refrained from attacking economic and strategic infrastructure in response to Egyptian threats to fire Scud missiles onto Israeli cities.\nIsrael managed to set up bridges and break through to the other end of the Suez canal, pushing into Egypt.\n\n\nInitial Syrian Attacks\n\nThe Syrians began their attacks with an airstrike against Israeli positions in the Golan Heights.\nSyrians pushed Israeli military lines back to the Southern Golan Heights.\nDayan discussed the possible arming of nuclear weapons in response to Syrian military gains. Meir rejected this option. Syrian mechanized brigades did not advance into Israel as they had feared an Israel nuclear response.\nMissiles from Syrian offensive lines struck civilian settlements in Israel, and in retaliation, seven Israeli F-4 Phantoms flew into Syria and attacked the Syrian General Staff Headquarters in Damascus.\n\n\nIsraeli Advance towards Damascus\n\nIsraeli troops advanced towards Damascus and began shelling the outskirts of the city from 30km away.\n\n\nArab Military Intervention\n\nSyria and Iraq sent expeditionary forces into Syria to defend from further Israeli military advancement.\nIsrael was able to launch strikes all across Syria, attacking power plants, petrol supplies, bridges and main roads.\n\n\nNaval Operations\n\nEgyptian missile boats bombarded Israeli positions on the Sinai coast on the first day of the war. Israeli missile boats decisively won these battles at sea.\nTwo Egyptian destroyers enforced a blockade, preventing oil from Iran being shipped to Israel through the straights of Bab-el-Mandeb.\n\n\nParticipation by other states\n\nThe US intelligence community, including the CIA, failed to predict the Egyptian-Syrian attack on Israel.\nMost officials in the Defense and Statement Departments opposed financing Israel, but Kissinger argued heavily in favor of supporting Israel so they would confirm to American views in postwar diplomacy.\nMeir authorized the assembly of thirteen 20-kiloton-TNT tactical nuclear weapons for Jericho missiles, done in an easily detectable way to signal to the United States. This was done on the 8-9th of October after previously rejecting this idea on the 7th.\nOn the 9th of October, after Kissinger learned of the nuclear alert, Nixon ordered the beginning of Operation Nickel Grass.\n\nThe US, over 32 days, airlifted 22,325 tons of tanks, artillery and ammunition to Israel.\nIn later interviews, Kissinger, Schlesinger and William Quandt suggested that the nuclear aspect was not a major factor influencing re-supply. They cite Soviet re-supply efforts and Sadat’s rejection of early ceasefires as being the primary motivators.\n\n\nThe Soviet Union supplied around 80,000 tons of supplies, mainly to Syria, and also to Egypt.\nSoviet advisors were reportedly involved in all areas of the war. 2,000 personnel in Syria, with 1,000 serving in Syrian air defense units. They also repaired damaged tanks, SAMs and radar equipment and assembled fighter jets.\nSoviet in advisors were reportedly present in all areas of Syrian command posts.\nIsrael may have captured and traded Soviet officers who were captured from the Syrian front, though Israel and the USSR denies this.\nIn Syria, a Soviet cultural center in Damascus and a merchant ship, Ilya Mechnikov, was sunk by the Israeli Navy.\nThis all occurred during the apex of the Watergate Scandal. Nixon was so agitated and discomposed that there were times with Kissinger and Haif didn’t bother to wake him for consultation.\nArab countries added up to 100,000 troops to Egypt and Syria’s frontline ranks.\n\nAlgeria, East Germany, North Korean, Pakistan, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Morocco, Tunisia, Lebanon and Sudan all sent forces, ammo, tanks, pilots, etc…\n\n\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nCeasefire\n\nOn October 22nd, 1973, the UNSC passed a 14-0 resolution calling for a ceasefire, negotiated mainly between the US and the USSR.\nFor the first time, three Scud Missiles were fired at Israeli targets by either Egyptian forces or Soviet personnel in Egypt, which was the first combat use of Scud Missiles. All three targets were in the Sinai.\nCeasefire claims to have been broken by both sides during the night, and Israel capitalized on the ceasefire break to advance beyond the UNSC ceasefire lines.\n\n\nEgypt’s Third Army\n\nThe US, seeing an opportunity to bring Egypt closer to its sphere of influence, exerted heavy pressure on Israel to refrain from destroying the trapped Third Army.\n\nKissinger told the Israeli ambassador, Simcha Dinitz, that the destroying of the Egyptian Third Army “is an option that does not exist.”\n\n\n\n\nPost-war Battles\n\nThe ceasefire wasn’t followed closely by either side, with the fighting not stopping until January 18th, 1974.\nThe Israeli Army was 100 km from Cairo after their advancement from the west bank.\n\n\nCeasefire\n\nOn the 22nd of October, UNSC Resolution 338 called for a ceasefire. The war would finally come to a close on the 26th of October.\nIsrael and Egypt signed a formal ceasefire on 11th of November, and the disengagement agreement happened on the 18th of January, 1974.\nThere was a secret agreement that Jordan and Israel would not heavily engage with each other. Hussein was pressured to enter the war to maintain his position of leadership and respect in the Arab world.\n\n\nResponse in Israel\n\nIsrael was shaken due to initial military difficulties and how unprepared they were in the beginning of the conflict.\nGolda Meir resign along with her entire cabinet, including Dayan.\n\n\nResponse in Egypt\n\nGeneral Shazly angered Sadat for advocating the withdrawal of Egyptian forces from Sinai and was kicked out of the army, would go into political exile and then was placed under house arrest upon his return.\nThe commanders of the Second and Third Armies, Khalil and Wasel, were also dismissed from the army.\n\n\nResponse in Syria\n\nIn Syria, Colonel Rafik Halawi, the Druze commander of an infantry brigade, was executed for his military performance.\n\n\nResponse from Soviet Union\n\nThey mad, gave lots of stuff to the Arabs and were upset that they still lost.\n\n\nArab Oil Embargo\n\nSaudi Arabia declared an embargo against the US, later joined by other oil exporters and extended against the Netherlands and other countries, causing the 1973 energy crisis.\n\n\nSyrian atrocities\n\nMany Israeli POWs were tortured or killed.\n\nSyrian Defense Minster Mustafa Tlass addressed the National Assembly in 1973 stating that he had awarded one solder the Medal of the Republic for killing 28 Israeli prisoners with an axe, decapitating three of them and eating the flesh of one of his victims. (Did this actually happen???)\n\nThe original Jewish Telegraphic Agency article quotes and says the soldier from Aleppo killed 28 Israeli soldiers, 3 with an axe and devoured the flesh of one of them in hand to hand combat.\n\n\n\n\nA soldier from the Moroccan contingent fighting with Syrian forces was found to be carrying a sack filled with the body parts of Israeli soldiers which he intended to take home as souvenirs.\nSyrian soldiers removed dog tags from bodies.\nSyria did not even officially acknowledge holding any prisoners to the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\n\nEgyptian atrocities\n\nMultiple Israeli claims of prisoners being shot and killed.\nPhotographic evidence of the torture/killings of Israeli POWs also exists.\nThe order to kill Israeli prisoners came from General Shazly, who, in a pamphlet distributed to Egyptian soldiers immediately before the war, advised his troops to kill Israeli soldiers even if they surrendered.\n\n\n\nImportant Notes"},"Research/Library/Events/1973.12.21-1974.05.31---Geneva-Conference-of-1973":{"title":"1973.12.21-1974.05.31 - Geneva Conference of 1973","links":["Research/Library/Geographics/Egypt","Research/Library/Geographics/Jordan","Research/Library/Geographics/Israel","Research/Library/People/Henry-Kissinger","Research/Library/Geographics/United-States","Research/Library/Geographics/Syria","Research/Library/Geographics/Golan-Heights","Research/Library/Geographics/West-Bank","Research/Library/Geographics/Gaza-Strip"],"tags":[],"content":"Sources\n\n“Geneva Conference (1973).” Wikipedia.

For the major problem in the Arab–Israeli conflict, as in many other intricate collisions throughout history, has always been the incapacity or unwillingness of leaders to conduct a peace policy that is not supported by what looked at the time like the legitimate, and frequently paralysing, consensus prevailing in their respective societies and polities. Leaders, more frequently than not, act as the hostages of the socio-political environment that produces them instead of shaping it.

(p. 168)\n                  \n                \n\nBut it took the almost Messianic commitment of President Carter and the most assertive and robust involvement of the United States to save the process from collapse and to force the parties to shoulder the formidable price of peace. ‘None of us believe we have much of a chance to succeed,’ confided Carter to his advisers when he invited the parties to the Camp David presidential retreat for a peace summit.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo.

His weariness with the Palestinians exploded into open rage when in February 1978 the chief editor of Al-Ahram and a personal friend of the President, Yusuf al-Sibai, was assassinated in Cyprus by a Palestinian squad, admittedly belonging to Abu Nidal’s splinter group, not to the PLO. To Sadat this was one more proof that Egypt was mortgaging its future for the sake of a people–‘pygmies’ and ‘hired killers’, as he put it to Israel’s Defence Minister Ezer Weizmann–who did not deserve Egypt’s sacrifices.\n\n\nFacts\n\nParticipating Parties\n\nCarter met with Sadat of Egypt, Hussein of Jordan, Hafez al-Assad of Syria, and Rabin of Israel.

The Israeli Prime Minister did not have insurmountable opposition at home. But he, or rather his conscience, was his own opposition. In order to calm it down he now had to prove that he, who had betrayed his pledge not to dismantle settlements, would not allow this to become a precedent for the West Bank. He would enhance the building of new settlements in Judaea and Samaria and he would block any possibility of the Palestinian autonomy ushering in a Palestinian state.\n\n\n\nSadat Initiative\n\nSadat seemed eager to make peace with Israel, even traveling to Jerusalem and speaking in front of the Knesset about potential peace.\nEgypt wanted to secure a future more in line with its own interests, rather than fixating on being part of the broader Arab collection of countries. There was also a belief that a bilateral peace agreement with Israel would cause a cascade of other peace agreements to happen in following.\n\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo.

(p. 87)\n                  \n                \n\nBy pushing Palestine to the forefront of the struggle against the Jewish state, Nasser radically changed the parameters of the conflict. Now it was no longer just a border dispute between sovereign states, and one that was susceptible to a rational solution, but a conflict of an almost mythological nature over the plight of the Palestinians and their ‘inalienable’ rights, where hardly any room for compromise could exist. It is from this perspective that Sadat’s peace initiative, in the wake of the Yom Kippur War, needs to be understood. To make peace he needed to extricate Egypt’s conflict with Israel from the paralysing hold of the Palestinian dilemma into which Nasser had locked it and bring it back to the realm of rationality as a solvable border dispute between two sovereign states.\n\n\n\nEgyptian-Israeli talks\n\nCarter pushed both leaders in Camp David for a broad peace agreement between the two.\n\n\nPartial agreements\n\nThe first part of the agreement focused on UN Resolution 242.\n\nWanted to establish self-governing authorities in the West Bank and Gaza strip.\nDeliberately left out talks about Jerusalem, and neglected the Golan Heights, Syria or Lebanon.\n\n\nThe second part of the agreement dealt with Egyptian-Israeli relations.\nA 5 year plan was given to have the West Bank and Gaza rule themselves autonomously. Again, Jerusalem was not mentioned nor was the Palestinian Right of Return.\n\n\nUN Rejection\n\nThe UN General Assembly rejected the Framework for Peace in the Middle East due to lack of participation of the UN and PLO. It did not comply with the Palestinian right of return, of self-determination and to national independence and soverignty.\nThe part of the Camp David accords regarding the Palestinian future and all similar ones were declared invalid.\n\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo.

(p. 170)\n                  \n                \n\nIt was Menachem Begin, not a left-wing radical, who subscribed at Camp David to such non-Jabotinskian concepts as these: ‘a recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and their just requirements’, ‘the resolution of the Palestinian problem in all its aspects’ and ‘the Palestinians will participate in the determination of their own future’. Moreover, not only did Begin agree to discuss the return to the territories of the displaced Palestinians who left the West Bank during the Six Day War, but he also consented to reopen the 1948 chapter, that is, to negotiate ‘the resolution of the 1948 refugee problem’. And if all this were not enough, Begin succumbed to Carter’s pressure and agreed to ‘Resolution 242 in all its parts’, thus implicitly also endorsing the Resolution’s preamble about ‘the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war’, and its possible applicability to other Arab fronts as well.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo.

This was a major missed opportunity by the Palestinian leadership. What was proposed to the Palestinians at Camp David, to use Oslo terms, was to turn the whole of the West Bank into Area B, that is, an area of Palestinian administrative rule and Israeli responsibility for security. Today, twenty-five years after Camp David and twelve years into the Oslo process, the Palestinians have hardly 20 per cent of the West Bank as Area B.\n\n\nOutcome\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo.

By pulling out from Sinai, Begin intimated, Israel had fulfilled the territorial aspects of Resolution 242 and no more withdrawals could be contemplated in future peace deals. From now on it would have to be ‘peace for peace’, not ‘peace for land’.

(p. 189)\n                  \n                \n\nThe political void created by the collapse of the London agreement–and now also by the evaporation of the Shultz initiative and the threat that the Intifada posed to the stability, and perhaps even to the very existence, of the Hashemite kingdom–encouraged King Hussein to take a dramatic step. He cancelled the Act of Annexation of the West Bank to Jordan and cut all administrative links to the West Bank. His attempts so far to reconcile Jordan’s historical claims to the West Bank, his commitment to the Arab consensus on the predominant role of the PLO, and his search for a settlement with Israel was an exercise in diplomatic juggling that was no longer sustainable. He left the stage to the PLO and in one stroke eliminated for ever the so-called Jordanian option from the diplomacy of peace. From now on, if the PLO wanted the territories back it had to change its policies and come to terms directly with Israel and the United States. Jordan would no longer serve as a diplomatic buffer or bridge.\n\n\n\nGeneral Causes\n\nIsrael opened up low and semi-skilled labor markets to Palestinians in occupied territory. By the time of the Intifada, over 40% of Palestinian workers were working in Israel daily.\nPalestinian populations were growing, but work and other opportunities were heavily restricted in the occupied territories.\nThe Jewish settler population in the West Bank grew from 35,000 in 1984 to 130,000 by the mid 1990’s.\nThe occupied Palestinians likely felt themselves humiliated in a variety of ways as indefinite occupation by Israel continued.\n\n\nBackground\n\nTwo potential causes that sparked the Intifada\n\nThe army tank transporter truck incident in which 4 Palestinians were killed by an Israel truck crashing into them.\nThe IDF failure in late November 1987 to stop a Palestinian guerrilla operation, the Night of the Gliders, in which six Israeli soldiers were killed.\n\n\nMass demonstrations occurred a year earlier after 2 Gaza students were shot by Israeli soldiers on campus on December 4th, 1986.\nThe Arab summit in Amman in November of 1987 focuses heavily on the Iran-Iraq war, sidelining the Palestinian issue for the first time in years.\n\n\n\nEvents\n\nLeadership and Aims\n\nThe Intifada was mainly lead by independent community councils and advocated for a non-violent approach so that the Palestinians would not lose support from liberal Israelis.\nFor the first time Palestinians are calling for the establishment of a Palestinian state on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, notably departing from the standard rhetorical calls for the “liberation” of all of Palestine.\n\n\nThe Intifada\n\nIsrael had assumed that its oppressive actions against the Palestinians would cause their resistance to collapse early, though this was a mistaken assumption.\nOn December 8th, 1987, an Israeli army tank transporter crashed into a row of cars, killing four Palestinians. They were residents of the Jabalya refugee camp, the largest of the eight refugee camps in the Gaza Strip. 7 others were seriously injured.\nAssumptions about the crash lead to demonstrations, which caused back and forth violence between Israelis and Palestinians.\nIn the beginning of the Intifada, no Israeli settlements were attacked nor were there any Israeli fatalities.\nThe IDF used every crowd control measure available, though disturbances continued to gain momentum.\nIsrael engaged in mass arrests and the closure of Palestinian schools and businesses, utilities and confinement to homes, as well as damage to farms and blockage from selling agricultural produce. Settlers also engaged in private violence against Palestinians.\n\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo. Scars of War, Wounds of Peace: The Israeli-Arab Tragedy. (p. 190)\n                  \n                \n\nIn the Intifada, as Amos Elon succinctly put it, the Palestinians discovered the power of their weakness and the Israelis the weakness of their power. The PLO was also in dire straits. Like Israel, it was taken by surprise by the Palestinian uprising. It suddenly realised that the real showdown with Israel was taking a totally different course from that preached and executed for years by an organisation of professional revolutionaries and terrorists. It was an irony of history that the biggest revolt by the Palestinians since the 1930s had begun without PLO direction. Its supremacy was now being effectively undermined by grass-roots revolutionary committees and a non-PLO United National Leadership of the Uprising (UNLU) that emerged throughout the territories and succeeded in establishing areas of Palestinian self-rule in different parts of the occupied lands. The PLO was also challenged by the dramatic surge of Islamic fundamentalist organisations like Hamas and Jihad, especially in Gaza.\n\n\nOutcome\n\nForeign reaction\n\nThe UN (including the US) drafted a resolution condemning alleged Israeli violations of human rights. Israel declared it would not abide by SCR672 because it did not pay attention to attacks on Jewish worshippers. Israel also blocked a delegation of the Secretary-General for investigating Israeli violence.\n\n\nOutcomes\n\nThe Intifada broke the image of Jerusalem as a united city, and the increase in international coverage was heavily critical of Israel.\nArafat and his followers moderated their political programme; at the meeting of the Palestine National Council in Algiers in November of 1988, Arafat won a majority for the historic decision to recognize Israel’s legitimacy, to accept all relevant UN resolutions (even 181 and 242 together) going back November 29th, 1947, and to adopt the principle of a two-state solution.\nArafat’s support for Sadam Hussein’s invasion into Kuwait essentially lead to a mass exodus of 300,000+ Palestinians fleeing Kuwait, mostly to return to Jordan. It also lead to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia cutting off financial support to the PLO.\n\n\n\nImportant Notes"},"Research/Library/Events/1991.03---Palestinian-Exodus-from-Kuwait":{"title":"1991.03 - Palestinian Exodus from Kuwait","links":["Research/Library/Governments/Palestinians","Research/Library/Geographics/Kuwait"],"tags":[],"content":"Sources\n\n”Palestinian exodus from Kuwait (1990-1991)” Wikipedia.

Once again, as so often in the past, one could watch with stupor and bewilderment the self-defeating nature of Palestinian nationalism. The PLO’s failure to join a coalition based on the same key principle on which the Palestinians had built their case–a principle that was, moreover, embedded in SCR 242, about the ‘inadmissibility of acquiring territory by force’–was a sad display of political stupidity which, moreover, morally spoiled the Palestinian case. This was how Arafat misunderstood and misrepresented to his people the coalition’s war to undo the Iraqi aggression against another Arab country: These are days of glory and pride and steadfastness of our Arab nation…. The real aim of the treacherous American aggression is not to enforce compliance with UN resolutions but to destroy Palestine and the Arab nation and make way for three million Russian Jews in a greater Israel stretching from the Nile to the Euphrates.\n\n\nFacts\nOutcome\nImportant Notes"},"Research/Library/Events/1991.10.30-1991.11.01---Madrid-Conference-of-1991":{"title":"1991.10.30-1991.11.01 - Madrid Conference of 1991","links":["Research/Library/Geographics/United-States","Research/Library/Geographics/Soviet-Union","Research/Library/Geographics/Israel","Research/Library/Geographics/Palestine","Research/Library/Geographics/Jordan","Research/Library/Geographics/Lebanon","Research/Library/Geographics/Syria","Research/Library/Geographics/Spain","Research/Library/Geographics/Middle-East"],"tags":[],"content":"Sources\n\nBen-Ami, Shlomo.

But the struggle for mastery in the Middle East by the two big powers blocked the possibility of a major peace breakthrough for years. Conspicuously, Egypt’s peace with Israel in 1979 started as a bold bilateral move behind the back of the superpowers. The Madrid Peace Conference of 1991, the Oslo accords of 1993 between Israelis and Palestinians, Israel’s peace with Jordan a year later, and the most serious attempts to reach an Israeli–Syrian settlement throughout the 1990s were all possible only after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo.

But Israeli rejectionism, as was frequently the case throughout the Arab–Israeli conflict, when not triggered by the Palestinians in the first place was certainly encouraged by them. The National Guidance Committee, a council of Palestinian notables in the territories, was created with one exclusive purpose, that of undermining and boycotting the autonomy talks, whatever their final objective might have been. The narrow window of opportunity that existed in 1967 for Israel to reach a deal with a local Palestinian leadership was now closed and sealed. In 1967, with Israel’s stunning victory still fresh in their mind and with the PLO still too weak to dictate the Palestinian agenda in the occupied territories, the local Palestinian leadership was eager to engage in peace talks with Israel. But Israel then preferred the politics of confusion and ambiguity. Now, thirteen years later, the PLO held the unchallenged monopoly of Palestinian politics and there was no chance whatever that any local leadership would be allowed to negotiate with Israel a watered-down autonomy plan, or any peace plan for that matter.\n\n\nFacts\nOutcome\nImportant Notes"},"Research/Library/Events/1993.09.13---Oslo-I-Accord":{"title":"1993.09.13 - Oslo I Accord","links":["Research/Library/Geographics/Washington,-D.C.","Research/Library/Geographics/United-States","Research/Library/People/Yitzhak-Rabin","Research/Library/People/Yasser-Arafat","Research/Library/Geographics/Israel","Research/Library/Governments/Palestine-Liberation-Organization","Research/Library/Geographics/Norway"],"tags":[],"content":"Sources\n\n”Oslo Accords” Wikipedia.

(p. 164)\n                  \n                \n\nVery few in the Arab world had much love for Arafat or for the PLO, ‘the cancer in our midst’, as King Hassan of Morocco defined it in his December meeting with Dayan and Tuhami. Years later this author would personally hear from the King, in his meeting with him in his Rabat palace in January 1993, similar harsh descriptions of Arafat and the PLO, an organisation he then confided to me had outlived its historical role and was becoming an obstacle to peace that needed to be dismantled. The King also related to me the advice he had given to Arafat’s deputy, Abu-Mazen, that the PLO should disband and allow the local Palestinian leadership in the territories to assume the responsibility for dealing directly with Israel. When I later reported my conversation with the King to Prime Minister Rabin he could not conceal his embarrassment, for it was precisely at that time that an Israeli team was negotiating in Oslo with a PLO delegation what later became known as the Oslo accords.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo.

It was the failure of his Syrian enterprise that brought Rabin to the White House lawn in Washington for his historic handshake with Arafat. It was precisely when the Oslo agreement was almost ready in early August 1993 that Rabin made his last and most dramatic attempt to stick to the capsule theory and to reach a deal with Assad. He conveyed to him a hypothetical readiness to accept Syria’s territorial claims if Syria would in turn accept Israel’s demands on security and normalisation. Assad’s disheartening response–he utterly rejected Israel’s concept of ‘normalisation’, and insisted on symmetrical and reciprocal security arrangements that would also affect the Israeli side of the new border–prompted Rabin to give the green light to the completion of the Oslo accords later that month. Israel’s chief negotiator with Assad’s men, Itamar Rabinovich, later recalled how Rabin expounded his rationale to Secretary of State Warren Christopher: ‘If Assad were to come forward and an Israeli–Syrian deal were to be made, then this would be supplemented by a small Palestinian deal. If Assad’s response is disappointing, there would be no Israeli–Syrian breakthrough, so then there would be a major Israeli–Palestinian agreement.’\n\n\nFacts\n\nIsrael and the PLO reached a mutual peaceful agreement\n\nThis called for the withdrawal of the IDF from parts of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank\nRemaining issues needed to be settled, including Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, Israeli settlements, security and borders.\nLetters of Mutual Recognition between the Israeli Government and the PLO were signed.\n\nIsrael recognized the PLO as the governing body of the Palestinians, the PLO renounced terrorism and other violence and its desire for the destruction of the state of Israel.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nReactions\n\nIn the Knesset a strong debate emerged between the left and right wing over support for the Oslo accords.\nFatah, the Palestinians present at the negotiations, accepted the accords, but Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), all objected to the accords.\nIsraelis were nervous that this peace process would simply be a part of the PLO’s Ten Point Program, which essentially calls for escalating steps until all of historic Palestine is liberated from Israel.\nPalestinians feared that Israel was not serious about dismantling their settlements in the West Bank, especially around Jerusalem.\nThe Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat.\nNetanyahu, in a secret recording, claims that his plan was to define “specified military locations” in the broadest possible sense according to the Oslo Accords, which could theoretically encompass the entirety of the Jordan Valley.\n\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo.

(p. 216)\n                  \n                \n\nIsrael’s annexationist policies further undermined Arafat’s legitimacy for making concessions and reinforced his instinct that he could not be seen as openly collaborating with the Israelis in fighting terrorism. This, in its turn, limited Rabin’s capacity to move forward in the process. Caught between the terror of the fundamentalists, Arafat’s passivity, and the inevitable ascendancy of the peace sceptics and the Israeli far right, Rabin was marching to his political demise. The frivolous oxymoron coined by Peres that the Israelis killed in terrorist attacks–between 1993 and 1996 about 300 Israelis were assassinated by suicide squads–were the ‘victims of peace’ was utterly rejected by the public. Terrorism undermined the legitimacy and the moral foundations of the peace process. Neither Arafat nor Rabin was now in a position to give the other the minimum required to keep Oslo alive. When Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish fanatic as a traitor who sold out Eretz-Israel, he was already severely crippled politically by a series of devastating suicide terrorist attacks, notably in Tel Aviv and Beit Lid, and by Arafat’s failure to face the enemies of peace in his own camp.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo.

(p. 220)\n                  \n                \n\nThe hysteria in Jordan was such that the moment he knew of the Oslo accord, the King ordered the closure of the bridges linking the West and the East Banks for fear of a mass exodus of Palestinians that would end up subverting the Jordanian state. The May 1994 Israeli–PLO economic agreement was an additional threat to Hussein, who now saw his kingdom’s economic ties with the West Bank seriously undermined. To the King a common Israeli–Palestinian economic space meant unemployment and political instability in Jordan.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo.

Now it was no longer the Jordanian option at the expense of the Palestinians, as both Israel and Jordan wanted it in the past, but a desperate rush to save Jordan’s interests and perhaps its very existence as an independent Bedouin kingdom, at a moment when the Palestinian option was picked up by Israel. It became vital for Hussein to make peace with Israel if he wanted to make sure that his nemesis, Arafat, would not have an exclusive say about the future of Jerusalem and the West Bank.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo.

The Americans were throughout sceptical that Hussein would dare to depart from his traditional policy of sitting on the fence. They did not realise how imperative the Oslo agreement made Jordan’s necessity to reach a settlement with Israel. Clearly, however, a much needed debt relief that the Clinton administration offered as a lure to the King if he made peace with Israel was a crucially important bonus that Hussein could not afford the luxury of ignoring.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo.

You decide.’ Arafat later reversed his position, but this moment in the summit clearly reflected his view of the peace process as not being about a mundane bargaining over real estate. Land mattered to him far less than emotional, legendary and Islamic values such as Jerusalem, the Temple Mount (Haram al-Sharif for the Muslims), and the core of the Palestinian national ethos, namely refugees.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo.

Rob Malley, in the analysis of the summit he co-authored with Hussein Agha, repeated this remark: ‘Indeed, the Palestinians’ principal failing is that from the beginning of the Camp David summit onward they were unable either to say yes to the American ideas or to present a cogent and specific counterproposal of their own.’\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo.

These certainly cannot be the outer limits of your concessions.’\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo. Scars of War, Wounds of Peace: The Israeli-Arab Tragedy.

But the exposure of the channel by the Palestinians themselves–as part of an internal political struggle within the Palestinian camp, Abu-Mazen’s people leaked the talks to Al-Hayat–destroyed any possibility for further progress. The channel stopped because it was not producing any longer. Exposed by his political rivals back home, who leaked imaginary details about his ‘irresponsible’ concessions, Abu-Ala quickly retreated to the safety of old, unyielding positions.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo.

(p. 256)\n                  \n                \n\nAmerica was not there, as some Palestinians might have thought, just to deliver Israel to a passive and rejectionist Arab side that was unwilling to engage in a serious negotiating process, nor would Israel allow herself to be delivered unconditionally. By failing to advance clear proposals and counter-proposals, that is, by refusing to engage in a real negotiating dynamic, the Palestinians deprived the Americans of the vital tools they needed to be able to put pressure on the Israelis. The President and his team could never ascertain whether the Palestinians were at all serious and genuine in their commitment to reach a settlement. As the President repeatedly told Arafat, he was not expecting him to agree to US or Israeli proposals, but he was counting on him to offer something, to produce a new idea that he could take back to Barak in order to convince him to make more concessions. ‘I need something to tell him,’ he implored. ‘So far I have nothing.’\n…\nTo no avail. Arafat would not budge from his position and would not agree to a qualified Palestinian sovereignty on the Temple Mount–he was offered in the site a ‘sovereign custodianship’ that was free of any Israeli interference–or to anything that was not the unequivocal partition of the city. He was offered a capital in Arab Jerusalem (not just Abu-Dis, as all kinds of non-official back channels had suggested in the past) that would include some Palestinian quarters under full Palestinian sovereignty and the others under a more qualified Palestinian sovereignty. Arafat demanded the sovereignty of three-quarters of the Old City and rejected out of hand any bridging ideas such as a special regime, which I had the opportunity to defend throughout the summit, or the President’s proposal, accepted by the Israelis, to divide the holy basin into two equal parts, the Christian and Muslim quarters to the Palestinians and the Jewish and Armenian quarters to the Israelis.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo.

To his last day, the Palestinian leader was still reluctant to acknowledge the real nature of the deal he was offered, and he obstinately kept repeating that he had no option but to reject the ridiculous map of enclaves and ‘Bantustans’ that was presented to him by an American–Israeli conspiracy.\n\n\n\nNegotiations continued through the Clinton Parameters, though no final agreement was reached, despite both sides claiming they were closer than they ever had been after the Taba negotiations in January of 2001.\nResponsibility for failure\n\nThe Americans, including Clinton and several observers, claim that the failure of the talks hinged on Arafat and the Palestinians refusal to give up on future negotiations relating to the Right of Return, which the Americans believed would ultimately result in the Palestinians fighting for a return to a one state solution in Historic Palestine.\nA Clinton special advisor complains that Israel was not willing to concede a reasonable amount to the Palestinians, considering how much they were already willing to give up, including Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem and trading favorable parts of the West Bank to Israel.\nSome argue that the lack of religious consideration hindered discussion around Jerusalem.\nFinkelstein argues that Israel really was giving up nothing at all that made the Palestinian concessions worth considering.\nPolling data around the time from Palestinians and their attitude towards Israel.\n\nweb.archive.org/web/20110607135527/http://www.pcpsr.org/survey/polls/2000/p1a.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo.

Israel wanted to silence for ever the voice of the witnesses to the crime and erase the proof of the Naqbah.’\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo.

Didn’t we destroy the pictures of President Clinton who so boldly presented us with proposals for a Palestinian state with border modifications? We are not being honest, for today, after two years of bloodshed we ask exactly that which we then rejected. … How many times did we agree to compromises, which we later rejected in order to miss them later on? And we were never willing to draw the lessons from our behaviour. … And then, when the solution was no longer available, we travelled the world in order to plead with the international community for what we had just rejected. But then we learnt the hard way that in the span of time between our rejection and our acceptance the world has changed and left us behind. … We clearly failed to rise up to the challenge of history.\n\n\nImportant Notes"},"Research/Library/Events/2000.09.28-2005.02.08---The-Second-Intifada":{"title":"2000.09.28-2005.02.08 - The Second Intifada","links":["Research/Library/Geographics/Israel","Research/Library/People/Ehud-Barak","Research/Library/People/Ariel-Sharon","Research/Library/Governments/Palestinian-Authority","Research/Library/Governments/Palestine-Liberation-Organization","Research/Library/Governments/Fatah","Research/Library/People/Yasser-Arafat","Research/Library/People/Mahmoud-Abbas","Research/Library/People/Marwan-Barghouti","Research/Library/Governments/Hamas","Research/Library/People/Ahmed-Yassin","Research/Library/People/Abdel-Aziz-al-Rantisi","Research/Library/People/Khaled-Mashal","Research/Library/People/Ismail-Haniyeh","Research/Library/People/Mohammed-Deif","Research/Library/Militaries/National-Security-Forces","Research/Library/Militaries/Al-Aqsa-Martyrs’-Brigades","Research/Library/Governments/Palestinian-Islamic-Jihad","Research/Library/Governments/Popular-Front-for-the-Liberation-of-Palestine","Research/Library/Governments/Democratic-Front-for-the-Liberation-of-Palestine","Research/Library/Governments/Popular-Resistance-Committees"],"tags":[],"content":"Sources\n\n”Second Intifada” Wikipedia.

Construction in the years following the Oslo Accords was still significantly less than prior, however.\nBarak secured an agreement for the dismantling of 12 new outposts in 1998, but continued expansion was occurring in existing settlements in the West Bank.

On these issues, we have to wage a campaign on the ground alongside the negotiations. I mean armed confrontation.

He rejected the possibility that anybody, even the President of the United States, would expect him to engage in negotiations. ‘I am a decision maker, not a negotiator,’ he told me. In retrospect, I am not sure he was a decision maker either.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo. Scars of War, Wounds of Peace: The Israeli-Arab Tragedy.

His Minister of Posts and Communications, Imad Faluji, declared in a speech in a refugee camp in south Lebanon that the Intifada against Israel was carefully planned after the failed Camp David talks in July 2000 ‘by request of President Yasser Arafat, who predicted the outbreak of the Intifada as a complementary stage to the Palestinian steadfastness in the negotiations, and not as a specific protest against Sharon’s visit to Al-Haram Al-Quds. … The Palestinian Authority instructed the political forces and factions to run all materials of the Intifada.’\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo.

(p. 267)\n                  \n                \n\nHe gave an implicit green light to the uprising by doing what he frequently liked to do in such conditions: he left the country in the very first days of the Intifada in order not to have to assume responsibility. Only through the Intifada could he restore his and the Palestinians’ international standing that had been so seriously eroded by the worldwide perception after the Camp David summit–a perception strongly enhanced by Clinton’s finger-wagging at Arafat as chiefly responsible for the collapse of the summit–of an Israeli government ready for a far-reaching compromise facing obstinate Palestinian rejectionism. Arafat knew that Palestinian casualties played in his favour in world opinion and helped increase the international pressure on Israel.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo. Scars of War, Wounds of Peace: The Israeli-Arab Tragedy. (p. 277)\n                  \n                \n\nThe weakness of the Barak government was of course due in great part to its own political blunders. But Arafat should also have wondered whether he would ever be able to reach an agreement with a ‘strong’ Israeli government when he so much excelled in weakening and eventually destroying his peace partners. Yitzhak Rabin paid with his life when he went for a dramatic breakthrough while Palestinian terrorism continued unabated, exposing him to Jewish extremists. In 1996 Shimon Peres was defeated amid an unprecedented wave of Palestinian suicide terror. And Ehud Barak suffered the greatest electoral débâcle in Israel’s political history because the voters saw the Intifada as Arafat’s counter-proposal to his peace initiative. To weaken and undermine Israeli left-wing governments, as he consistently did, and then refuse to make an agreement with them because they were ‘weak’ is a pattern that might keep the Palestinians in a permanent impasse. Ariel Sharon’s policies of scorched earth in the territories have been proof for Arafat that he who sows a wind ends by reaping a whirlwind. Arafat was a victim of his own illusions. He had a tendency to attribute to himself characteristics of a brilliant strategist and distinguished military man, ‘a general who never lost a war’, as he liked to introduce himself. But the truth is that as a strategist, of all people he proved his failure again and again. He always pushed his luck to the point where he lost all his achievements and what appeared to be a chance for reasonable victory ultimately became a disgraceful defeat. With Arafat, brinkmanship had no brakes; it was the art of bringing both his people and the Israelis to the edge of the abyss and beyond.\n\n\nEvents\n\nFirst days of the intifada\n\nViolence broke out heavily in the days following, with losses on the Palestinian side far outweighing Israeli losses.\nThe broadcasted killing of Muhammad al-Durrah, caught by a French news crew, was initially assumed to be the responsibility of the IDF, which they promptly apologized for, though much controversy remains over who actually shot and killed the boy. www.youtube.com/watch\n\n\nThe October 2000 events\n\nSeveral clashes occurred within Israel and the Gaza Strip, followed by a general strike, more escalations with police, thousands of Jews participating in violent acts in Tel Aviv, and a recommendation from the Or Commission to dismiss Shlomo Ben-Ami from Minister of Public Security.\n\n\nThe Ramallah lynching\n\nThe PA police arrested two Israeli reservists who had accidentally entered Ramallah, where a hundred Palestinians had been killed in the preceding weeks.\nAn Italian television crew captured and broadcasted the killings, where both soldiers were beaten, stabbed and disembowelled, with one body being set on fire.\n\n\nNovember and December\n\nClashes continue. Israel settlements in Gilo come under Palestinian heavy machine gun fire from Beit Jala.\nPalestinian deaths continue to outnumber Israeli deaths.\n\n\n2001\n\nThe Taba Summit failed to produce results by the end of January.\nOn January 17th, an Israeli teenager, Ofir Rahum, was murdered after being lured into Ramallah by a 24-year-old Palestinian, a member of Fatah’s Tanzim, after an online relationship had sparked.\nAfter Sharon’s election in 2001 over Barak, he refuses to meet with Yasser Arafat.\nMore violence occurs through March, with 8 Israelis and 26 Palestinians dying. In Hebron, a Palestinian sniper is reported by the IDF to have intentionally targeted and shot/killed a 10 month old Israeli baby.\nIn May of 2001, the IDF captured a vessel carrying $10m of weapons from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which was destined for the Gaza coast.\nOn June 1st a suicide bombing killing 21 Israeli civilians, most high schoolers, by the Islamic Jihad, hampered the American attempts to negotiate a cease-fire.\n\n\n2002\n\nThe IDF captured Karine A, a freighter carrying weapons from Iran, believed to be intended for Palestinian militant use against Israel. It was claimed that top officials in the PA were involved in the smuggling.\nOn the 28th of March the Arab Peace Initiative, endorsed by Arafat, encourages a two state solution, with Israel withdrawing all troops to the pre 1967 borders, with a full Right of Return for every Arab Palestinian.\nOn the 29th of March, Operation Defensive Shield has the IDF making incursions throughout the West Bank. The UN estimates 497 Palestinians killed and 1,447 wounded, with 4,258 arrested.\nIn April, the Battle of Jenin takes place. This was a huge battle seeing fierce urban combat by the IDF to clear out the refugee camp of the city of Jenin.\n\n\n2003\n\nIsraeli intelligence report claimed Arafat had paid $20,000 to the al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades.\n\nUS pressure caused the PA to appoint Mahmoud Abbas as the Palestinian prime minister.\n\nMahmoud Abbas has a thesis that the early Zionist leaders and Nazi leaders collaborated to encourage Jewish migration to Mandatory Palestine.\n\n\n\n\nOn June of 2003, a temporary armistice was unilaterally declared by Fatah, Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Fighting continues.\nAfter an August 19th Hamas suicide bus attack, the IDF were ordered to kill or capture all Hamas leadership in Hebron and the Gaza Strip, with at least all of the bus suicide bombing plotters being captured or killed, and Hamas leadership in Hebron being badly damaged.\nIn later 2003, the Israeli West Bank barrier is constructed. Israel claims its necessary to prevent terrorists from entering Israeli cities, while Palestinians claim it separates their communities and acts as a de facto annexation of their territory.\n\n\n2004\n\nThe IDF operates heavily in Rafah, to search and destroy smuggling tunnels used by militants to obtain a variety of weapons and supplies. Between 2000-2004, 90 tunnels connecting Egypt and the Gaza Strip were found and destroyed.\n\n16,000 Palestinians are displaced as the IDF demolishes what they are claim are empty or militant homes.\n\n\nIn February, Ariel Sharon announced a plan to withdraw all Jewish settlers from the Gaza Strip.\n\nYossi Beilin, a peace advocate and the architect of the Oslo Accords and the Geneva Accord, rejected the proposed withdrawal plan and claimed that without a peace agreement in place, it would reward terror.\n\n\nAfter announcing the declaration plan, two subsequent Hamas leaders, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, and his successor, Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi were killed.\n\n\n2005\n\nPalestinian presidential elections were held on the 9th of January, with Mahmoud Abbas winning the election.\n\nAbbas was a platform of peaceful negotiation with Israel and non-violence to achieve Palestinian objectives.\nSharon froze all diplomatic and security contacts with the PNA until Abbas shows a real effort to stop the terror.\nAbbas ordered Palestinian police to deploy in northern Gaza to prevent Qassam rocket and mortar shelling over Israeli settlements. Attacks would decrease sharply soon after.\n\n\n\n\nOn February 8th, Sharon and Abbas declared a mutual truce.\n\nHamas and Islamic Jihad said the truce doesn’t affect them.\n25-50 Qassam rockets and mortar shells were fired into an Israeli Gaza settlement, Neve Dekalim. Abbas ordered the PA security forces to stop such attacks in the future, and fired senior commanders in the PA security apparatus.\nIDF forces arrested Maharan Omar Shucat Abu Hamis, a Palestinian resident of Nablus, who was about to launch a suicide bus attack in the French Hill in Jerusalem.\nOn February 13th, Abbas engages Islamic Jihad and Hamas in talks to respect the truce.\nIsmail Haniyah, a senior leader of the group Hamas, said its position will remain unchanged and Israel will bear responsibility for any new violation of aggression.\nPalestinian factions continued to attack settlements in Gaza and cities in Israel, until July 15th, when Israel resumed its targeted killing policy.\nHamas militants are battling PA policemen in the streets.\n\n\n\nOutcome\n\nAftermath\n\nOn February 8th, 2005, Sharon and Abbas reach a truce, with Sharon releasing 900 Palestinian prisoners, withdrawing from West Bank towns, and finishing the Gaza withdrawal.\n\nAbbas reached an agreement 5 days later with Hamas and the PIJ to ensure the truce remains as long as Israeli violations did not happen.\n\n\nA number of people from Hamas leadership and a former military commander of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine all claim that Arafat had pre-planned the Second Intifada after realizing he would not get the concessions he wanted in the Camp David Accords. His widowed wife, Suha Arafat also claimed the same.\nIsraeli’s unilateral pullout from Lebanon was seen by the PLO as “optimistic”, and an “example for other Arabs seeking to regain their rights.”\nIsraeli’s military response in 2001 destroyed much infrastructure that was involved in the arming of Palestinian forces; some 90 paramilitary camps had been set up to train Palestinian youths in armed conflict. Some 40,000 armed and trained Palestinians existed in the occupied territories.\nMarwan Barghouti, the leader of the Fatah Tanzim, claimed he was attempting to instigate a second intifada leading up to the al-Aqsa visit by Sharon, contacting all Palestinian factions throughout Palestine. He also claimed that Israel’s withdrawal from Lebanon was a factor which contributed to the Intifada.\n\n\nMore Aftermath\n\nOn January 25th, 2006, Hamas won the Palestinian elections with an unexpected majority of 74 seats, compared to 45 for Fatah.\n\n\nIn the 2001 and 2002 Arab League Summits, the Arab states pledged support for the Second Intifada just as they had pledged support for the First Intifada in two consecutive summits in the late 1980s.\n\nImportant Notes\n\nNoteworthy things for modern conflict\n\nHistory of huge employment of suicide bombers explicitly targeting civilians.\nHistory of shipments of weapons via ocean into Gaza Strip.\nHistory of hiding militants inside “refugee” camps/cities.\nHistory of one-sided military capability of Israel vs the Palestinians.\nHistory of Israel denying UN or Human Rights groups to investigate after battles.\nIsraeli government explicit support for settler camps and refusal to remove them (Netenyahu and Sharon).\n\n\n"},"Research/Library/Events/2006.07.12-2006.08.14---The-2006-Lebanon-War":{"title":"2006.07.12-2006.08.14 - The 2006 Lebanon War","links":["Research/Library/Geographics/Israel","Research/Library/People/Ehud-Olmert","Research/Library/People/Dan-Halutz","Research/Library/Geographics/Lebanon","Research/Library/Governments/Hezbollah","Research/Library/People/Shaikh-Hassan-Nasrallah"],"tags":[],"content":"Sources\n\nWikipedia, “2006 Lebanon War” - Accessed 2024-05-29\nPatrick Porter, “Military Orientalism: Eastern War Through Western Eyes”, chapter 7. 2009.\n\nBelligerents\n\nIsrael\n\nNotable Leaders\n\nPrime Minister - Ehud Olmert\nChief of Staff - Dan Halutz\n\n\nStrength in numbers\n\n\n\n\n\nLebanon\nHezbollah\n\nNotable Leaders\n\nLeader - Shaikh Hassan Nasrallah\n\n\nStrength in numbers\n\n\n\nCasualties and losses\n\nCountry/Faction 1\n\nDeaths\nWounded\nImprisoned\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry/Faction 2\n\nDeaths\nWounded\nImprisoned\n\n\n\nLocation\nCauses\nHezbollah captured two IDF soldiers.\nEvents\nIsrael dramatically underestimated Hezbollah and failed to achieve the ambitious political objectives it had set out to accomplish, namely the swift dismantling of Hezbollah while maintaining political good-will with the world.\nIsrael made a massive error in assuming that Hezbollah was strictly a primitive guerrilla army incapable of utilizing sophisticated warfare, such as the launching of missiles or intercepting of Israeli communications.\nThe world was not a neutral battleground for the Israeli state, either.

Hamas contends that Israel never eased up off the blockade.\nThe UN recorded 7 IDF violations of the ceasefire between June 20th-26th.\n9 rockets were fired into Israel in 3 separate violations from the 23rd-26th of June by non-Hamas Palestinian groups.\n\nIslamic Jihad reportedly fired these rockets in retaliation for Israeli assassinations of their members in the west bank.\n\n\nIsrael did not comply well with the easing of the blockade after the truce was accepted.\n\nIs this true? Why not?\n\n\nThe Carter Center recorded, based on UN OCHAO data, that the blockade was not eased very much.\nIsrael accused Hamas of continuing to allow rocket fire from the Gaza strip and continued smuggling of weapons.\nThe IDF was accused of continuing to violate the ceasefire agreement, attacking, killing, and bulldozing parts of the Gaza strip despite Hamas adherence to said ceasefire.\n\nPre-war escalations\nNovember 4th IDF raid and aftermath\n\nIn November 4th, 2008, Israel launched Operation Double Challenge into Dayr al-Balah in central Gaza to destroy what they claimed was an opening of a cross-border tunnel concealed within a building 300 meters from the border.\nMany seem to blame Israel for the failure of the ceasefire.\n\nTunnel threat\n\nDr. Ido Hart, an Israeli defence analyst, defined three types of Gaza tunnels: smuggling from Egypt, defensive tunnels for storage and protection, and offensive cross-border penetrations into Israel by Gaza militants.\nRobert Pastor, who was involved in the indirect 2008 Hamas-Israel negotiations, stated he was unsure that the tunnels were going to be used for offensive purposes.\n\nRaid\n\nInfantry, bulldozers and tanks crossed 250 meters into the Gaza strip to destroy the tunnel.\nHamas launched 35 rockets into southern Israel in response.\n\nImmediate repercussions\n\nRocket attacks increased after the 4th of November cross-border attacks, with more than 200 Qassam rockets and mortar shells landing in the western Negev region between November 4th and mid-December.\n\nDecember repercussions\n\nOn December 13th, both Israel and Hamas fought over who was committing themselves to the truce, with both sides accusing the other of violating it continuously.\nRocket fire and IDF attacks continued throughout the next two weeks of negotiations for a truce/ceasefire.\nOn the 24th of December, Hamas issued a statement to begin “Operation Oil Stain.”\n\n87 Palestinian mortar shells, Katyusha and Qassam rockets hit the Negev.\n\n\n\nEvents\nTimeline of the war\nIsraeli offensive\n\nIsrael had been planning this offensive for 6 months prior to the beginning of the conflict and initiated in response to their “patience running out” (Ehud Barak) over rocket attacks.\n\nAir strikes\n\nOn December 27th, 2008, Israel launched “Operation Cast Lead.”\n\nF-16 fighter jets and AH-64 Apache attack helicopters struck 100 preplanned targets within 220 seconds, then returned with a second wave to strike an additional 60 targets.\n\n\nThe IDF accused Hamas of hiding in the al-Shifa basement, attempting to utilize human shields.\nThe IDF took multiple precautions to reduce civilian casualties\n\nThey used A-4 Skyhawks to drop more than 2 million leaflets\nThey engaged in roof knocking on civilian buildings.\nThe IDF issued warning calls before air strikes on civilian buildings.\nThey contacted residents of a building to leave 10-15 minutes before an attack.\nThe IDF used sound bombs to warn civilians before striking homes.\nIn some cases, the IDF commanders called off airstrikes, when residents of suspected houses have been able to gather on its roof.\n\n\n\nNaval operations\n\nIsrael launched attacks from sea.\nThey reportedly attacked an Iranian ship loaded with arms for Hamas, which was docking in Sudan.\nOn December 29th, Israeli navy patrol turned back a Free Gaza Movement relief boat, Dignity.\n\nGround Invasion\n\nThe ground invasion began on January 3rd, Israel pushed into and destroyed parts of the city.\n\nArms interdiction and the Sudan strike\n\nIn January and February of 2009, there were two air strikes in Sudan and one in the Red Sea allegedly conducted by Israel against Iranian smuggled arms shipments.\n\nAttack on Gaza City\n\nOn January 7th, Israel launched 40 airstrikes overnight, then entered Central Gaza with troops.\nAlmost all members of Hamas’ 100-man “Iranian Unit” were killed during a battle in the Zeytoun neighborhood on January 15th.\nThe UNRWA was shelled on January 15th, with tons of food and fuel being destroyed in the process.\n\nAfter an investigation, the IDF claimed that militants ran for safety inside the U.N. compound after firing on Israeli forces from outside.\n\n\n\nHumanitarian Ceasefires\n\nThere were daily (or every other day) ceasefires to allow humanitarian aid into the Gaza strip.\nPhysicians for Human Rights and the Palestinian Medical Relief Society noted that local testimonies claimed IDF ground forces breached the daily ceasefire agreement.\n\nPalestinian paramilitary activity\n\nIslamic Jihad, the PFLP, Saiqa, the Popular Struggle Front, the Revolutionary Communist Party, Palestinian Liberation Organization, Fatah’s ‘Intifada’ faction, and others issued a joint statement refusing any security arrangement that doesn’t include an end to the blockade and an opening of all of Gaza’s crossings.\n\nPreparation\n\nHamas prepared for months leading up to the war by booby-trapping houses and building extensive systems of tunnels.\nThe IDF claims Hamas members hid weapons caches under their homes.\nThe IDF claimed satellite dishes were armed with bombs and that one-third of houses with booby-trapped. They also claimed schools were booby-trapped as well.\nThe IDF claimed anti-personnel IED’s were planted, manufactured from medicine bottles transferred to the Gaza strip as humanitarian aid by Israel.\n\nThey also claimed that Hamas representatives said they were fighting with the aid of armored vehicles and weapons confiscated from the Palestinian National Authority.\n\n\nShin Bet released details that mosques were used for weapon caches and military training.\nMilitants admitted to the location of Hamas weapon storage sites in tunnels, in the homes of activists, and in citrus groves and mosques.\n\nPalestinian rockets in Gaza\n\nTwo rockets hit friendly targets in Gaza, and according to Human Rights Watch witnesses on the ground reported that Hamas police came and confiscated the shrapnel parts.\n\nRocket attacks into Israel\n\nBoth Fatah and Hamas were firing rockets from Gaza into Israel.\nThe UN Fact finding mission and HRW noted that the firing of rockets at Israel constituted a deliberate attack against the civilian population and was in violation of international law.\nRockets were also fired into Israel from Lebanon and Syria.\n\nOutcome\nUnilateral ceasefires\n\nOn January 17th, 2009, Israel announced a unilateral ceasefire to go into effect that night, at 0:00 January 18th.\n\nContinued negotiations\n\nEgypt urged Britain, France and Germany to stop sending warships to patrol off the waters of Gaza.\nIsrael wanted international aid groups to control aid from donations around the world to avoid money ending up in the hands of Hamas.\nHamas still wanted a full border opening, not just for humanitarian aid.\nEhud Olmert, the Israeli PM, would not agree to a truce or blockade lift without the freeing of Gilad Shalit, but Hamas demanded Israel release 1,400 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Shalit, and for those negotiations to be kept separate from ceasefire negotiations.\n\nEffects\n\nEarly estimates say $2billion lost in assets, including 4,000 homes destroyed, 600-700 factories, 24 mosques, 31 security compounds, and 10 water/sewage lines.\n\nOn January 22nd, 2010, Israel paid $10.5mil in compensation to the UN for property damage.\n\n\n\nGaza humanitarian crisis\n\nHeavy damage on the agriculture industry in the Gaza Strip after the war.\nMore than 50,800 Gazans were left homeless.\nOn January 7th, 2009, UNRWA claimed blankets and food parcels were stolen by Hamas. after some communication, these supplies were returned.\nInjured patients needing referral outside Gaza for specialized care were evacuated exclusively through the Egyptian Rafah border crossing. In the early stages of the conflict, Hamas sealed the border, and prevented wounded Palestinians from seeking medical attention in Egypt.\n\nEffects on Israel\n\nEffects of rocket attacks paralyzed southern Israel during the conflict.\nHamas’ Grad rockets’ increased range of 40 km put more than 700,000 Israelis within strike range.\n\nInternational law\n\nIn April 2012, the International Criminal Court (ICC) rejected the Palestinian Authority’s (PA) request that Israel be investigated for claimed war crimes in Gaza in 2009, holding that since the PA is recognized by the UN General Assembly as an “observer” rather than a “state”, the ICC lacked jurisdiction to hear its request.\n\nImportant Notes\nCivilians versus combatants\n\nIn The Jerusalem Post, Israeli-Arab journalist Khaled Abu Toameh suggested that killed fighters in civilian clothes led to the over-counting of civilian casualties and under-counting Hamas military casualties, as Palestinian casualties arrived at hospitals without weapons or any other signs revealing they were fighters.\n\nDid this actually happen?\n\n\n\nGazan police\n\nIsrael allegedly attacked a police cadet graduation ceremony early on in the war. Over 250 policeman were killed by Israeli actions.\n\nLegality\n\nThe UN fact Finding Mission declared that targeting the Gaza police was a violation of international humanitarian law.\nHRW and B’Tselem said that generally police officers are presumed to be civilians.\n\nIsraeli Views\n\nThe IDF claims that the police officers were being trained as militants and that Hamas leadership presented these organizations as Jihadists for Palestine.\nIsraeli Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center alleges that the internal security forces serve as Hamas militants, and that police officials stated that police were to fight the enemy in case of invasion.\n\nGazan rockets\n\nOver 750 rockets and mortars were fired from Gaza into Israel during the conflict wounded 182 civilians, killing 3 people, and causing minor suffering to another 584 people suffering from shock and anxiety. Several rockets landed in schools and one fell close to a kindergarten, all located in residential areas. The UN fact finding mission stated that this constituted a deliberate attack against the civilian population and was unjustifiable in international law.\n\nAftermath\n\nHamas refused to recognize Israel, accept the Oslo accords and abandon violence in exchange for international recognition as representatives of the Palestinian people.\nIn November 2010, after previously stating lower numbers, the Hamas Interior Minster acknowledged that around 700 militants either part of Hamas or affiliated factions were killed in the war.\nIn the year prior to the war, Hamas had fired over 3,300 rockets, with that number dropping to below 300 in the ten months following the conflict.\n\nPropaganda and psychological warfare\nHamas\n\nHamas texted Israeli citizens warning of rocket fire in Tel’Aviv, broadcasted inaccurate numbers of Israeli soldiers killed, and used Gilad Shalit as a form of intimidation against Israeli soldiers.\n\nIsrael\n\nAn Islamic Jihad broadcaster claimed Israel was breaking into its broadcasts once an hour to broadcast messages negative about Hamas to the Gazan population.\nIsraelis also dropped leaflets stating that the Gazans were suffering due to Hamas.\n\nCriticism of IDF\nCollective punishment\n\nThe Goldstone Report claimed that Israel was collectively punishing those in Gaza.\n\nDisproportionate force\n\nHuman rights groups accused Israel of using disproportionate force.\n\nIDF use of human shields\n\nOn March 24th, a UN team report claimed it found hundreds of violations of the rights of children and accused Israeli soldiers of using children as human shields.\nThe Guardian made a similar claim, that testimony from three Palestinians aged 14, 15, and 16 also claimed to have been used as human shields.\n\nWhite Phosphorous\n\nThe Goldstone report and Human Rights Watch claimed that Israel used white phosphorous in the conflict, with the latter claiming it was done indiscriminately in a way that would amount to contravention of international law.\n\nDense inert metal explosives (DIME)\n\nIt was alleged that Israel utilized these, though they are not against international law.\n\nAccusations of misconduct by IDF soldiers\n\nIn July 2009, the Israeli NGO Breaking the Silence published testimony from soldiers, claiming that the IDF used Gazans as human shields and fired improperly on civilian areas.\n\nDid this happen?\n\n\nThese claims were rebutted by the IDF, claiming they were all hearsay or secondhand accounts.\n\nProsecutions\n\nOne IDF soldier prosecuted for stealing a Visa card from a Palestinian home and spending money with it.\n\nConvicted and sentenced to 7 1/2 months in military prison.\n\n\nTwo soldiers fired white phosphorous to cover troop retreats in Tel al-Hawa, causing a UNRWA compound to be set on fire.\n\nAn IDF investigation found that there was likely no criminal activity, so the case was not referred for criminal investigation.\n\n\n\nCriticism of Palestinian factions\nCivilians as human shields\n\nAmnesty International claimed Hamas did not use any human shields.\nIAF videos allegedly show terrorists using groups of children as cover.\nThe commander of the military-terrorist wing of the PFLP-GC in the Gaza Strip stated in an interview that some areas did not present a problem because of the “population and building density” that would “provide the resistance with a shield”.\nProfessor Newton, an expert in laws of armed conflict testifying in front of a United Nations Fact Finding Mission, criticized a statement by a Hamas brigade commander who said, “The entire people of Gaza are the combatants and therefore, it is appropriate for us to issue warnings and then whether – if, even if they disregard them, to occupy their basement or their house or their backyard.”\nDuring the Gaza War, Hamas invested great effort in preventing civilians from leaving neighborhoods that were in the line of fire and letting them flee to the south of the Strip.\n\nCombatant use of civilian\n\nThere were claims that Hamas consistently dressed in civilian clothing to fight.\n\nMilitary use of medical facilities and uniforms\n\nAn IDF investigation concluded that Hamas forced the Red Crescent to hand over medic and nurse uniforms for militants and commandeered ambulances for fighter transportation.\nAn ambulance driver registered with and trained by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society spoke of Hamas’ efforts to “lure the ambulances into the heart of a battle to transport fighters to safety” and the hijacking of the al-Quds Hospital’s fleet of ambulances.\nAfter an Israeli airstrike on the central prison, which resulted in prisoners being released into the streets, several of the 115 prisoners accused of collaboration with Israel who had not yet been tried were executed by Hamas militants wearing civilian clothes in the Shifa hospital compound.\nThe IDF claimed that Hamas operated a command and control center inside Shifa Hospital in Gaza City.\nThe Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, an Israel-based group with close ties to the Israeli military establishment, reported that Hamas made extensive use of the Al-Fahoura Medical Centre and that they established a military camp and training base next to it. The ITIC released aerial pictures showing tunnels dug around the building and the medical centre and that the area surrounding the hospital was heavily mined. Rockets were launched in close proximity of the centre. The ITIC report stated that Hamas used 10 Gazan hospitals for launching rockets at Israeli towns and for attacking IDF troops.\nHamas also set up a command centre within a children’s hospital located in the Nasser neighbourhood of Gaza City.\nAmnesty International rejected the charges by Israel that Hamas had systematically used medical facilities, vehicles and uniforms as a cover, stating that no evidence had been provided proving such actions.\n\nMedia\nDenied media access\n\nReporter access to the war zone was limited. During the Gaza raids against Hamas, the Israeli army denied international media access to the conflict zone, against a decision by the Israeli Supreme Court to lift the embargo.\n\nAttacks on the media\n\nMedia facilities in Gaza, both foreign and domestic, came under Israeli fire in the military campaign.\nOn one occasion a Grad rocket may have been launched from a location near the television studios in the Al-Shuruk tower in Gaza City. Although the Israeli recording of a reporter describing a rocket launch was during the initial aerial bombardment phase the tower was only bombed in the final few days.\n\nNew media\n\nYouTube and other forms of new media became relevant during this conflict.\n\nReactions\n\nThe conflict triggered a wave of reprisal attacks against Jewish targets in Europe and elsewhere. The worldwide number of recorded anti-Semitic incidents during the conflict more than tripled the number of such incidents in the same period of the previous year, marking a two-decade high.\n\nReactions in Israel\n\nThe war provoked mixed reactions inside Israel, with the Jewish majority largely supporting it, and the Arab minority mostly opposing it. A poll taken on 8 January 2009 showed that 91% of the Jewish public supported the war, and 4% opposed it, while a separate poll conducted 4–6 January showed a 94% approval of the war among Jews and 85% disapproval among Israeli Arabs.\nThe largest Arab demonstrations in Israel’s history took place.\n"},"Research/Library/Events/2014.07.08-2014.08.26---2014-Gaza-War":{"title":"2014.07.08-2014.08.26 - 2014 Gaza War","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Sources\n\nMain Source - Wikipedia Entry - 2014 Gaza War\nBBC News. 2014. “Caution Needed with Gaza Casualty Figures,” August 8, 2014, sec.

According to court documents, he stated that Hamas members in Gaza financed the recruitment and arming of the killers of the 3 abducted teenagers.\n\nImpact\nOn Gaza residents\n\nIsrael set up an IDF field hospital for Gazans at the Erez Crossing\nEgypt temporarily reopened the Rafah crossing to allow medical supplies to enter.\nFatah officials accused Hamas of mishandling humanitarian aid meant for civilians, claiming the took the aid and either distributed it to Hamas members or sold it on the black market.\nAlmost 300,000 Palestinians were displaced, with many lacking access to good food, water, or shelter.\nMany churches and mosques were destroyed.\n\nThe IDF claimed ammunition was stored in these mosques, though in on AP report residents denied that certain mosques damaged by the IDF had been used for military purposes.\n\n\n\nOn Israeli residents\n\nRockets were fired into Israel and damaged civilian infrastructure, causing the Tel-Aviv airport to be closed or reroute flights for some days.\n\nCasualties and losses\nPalestinian\n\nAbout 2,200 Palestinians were killed.\n\nHamas reported that about 75% of these were civilians.\nThe IDF claims that about 49% were militants.\n\n\nIt’s worth nothing that it’s difficult to know exactly how many civilians vs militants were killed, though it would appear that the large number of fighting-aged men that were killed heavily implies a large number of them were militants.\n\nIsraeli\n\n67 soldiers were killed.\n\nReactions\nGaza\n\nAfter the 26 August ceasefire, the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research conducted a poll in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip: 79% of respondents said that Hamas had won the war and 61% said that they would pick Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh as the Palestinian president, up from 41% before the war.\nThe Washington Post claims a percentage of Gazans held Hamas accountable for the humanitarian crisis.\n\nSome claim that Hamas routinely accuses protestors of being Israeli spies and has killed more than 50 such protestors.\n\n\n\nIsrael and the West Bank\n\nTowards the end of the war, after Israel announced the withdrawal of ground forces from Gaza, a poll found 92% support for the war among the Jewish public, and that 48% believed that the IDF had used the appropriate amount of firepower in the operation, while 45% believed it had used too little and 6% believed it had used too much.\nThe poll also found that 62% of Israeli-Arabs believed the operation was unjustified while 24% believed it was justified, and that 62% believed too much firepower was used, 10% believed too little firepower was used, and 3% thought the appropriate amount of firepower was used.\n\nAlleged violations of international humanitarian law\n\nHamas leader Ismail Haniyeh urged the PA to sign the Rome Statues of the ICC.\n\nThem not doing so has prevented the ICC from launching formal investigations.\n\n\nIsrael continued to block independent organizations from investigations into the Gaza strip.\n\nAlleged violations by Hamas\nKilling and shooting of Gazan civilians\n\nIn a rush to launch rockets into Israel, many Hamas launches failed with rockets landing in the Gaza strip.\nBombs dropping on Al-Shifa Hospital were claimed by both sides to be by the other.\nAmnesty International concluded that the explosion at the Shati refugee camp on July 28th (13 civilians dead) were caused by a Palestinian rocket, despite Palestinian claims that it was an Israeli missile.\n\nKilling of suspected collaborators\n\nHamas executed suspected collaborators in Gaza, then brought victims to hospitals to be added to the number of civilian casualties of Israeli operations.\n\nThis was condemned by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Palestinian human rights groups.\n\n\nOn May 26th, 2015, Amnesty International released a report saying that Hamas carried out extrajudicial killings, abductions and arrests of Palestinians and used the Al-Shifa Hospital to detain, interrogate and torture suspects. It details the executions of at least 23 Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel and torture of dozens of others, many victims of torture were members of the rival Palestinian movement, Fatah.\n\nEndangerment of Civilians\nHuman shields\n\nThe EU condemned Hamas and calls for the civilian population to provide themselves as human shields.\nFrance24, The Financial Times, and RT, all filmed a rocket launch pad placed in a civilian area next to a hotel where international journalists were staying.\nIn September of 2014, a Hamas official acknowledged to an AP reporter that the group had fired rockets from civilian areas.\n\nUse of civilian structures for military purposes\n\nClaim that training manuals were found on urban warfare that states essentially how to utilize co-location of military and civilian objects and human shields.\n\nSource for this claim is the New York Post, is there any other corroborating source?\n\n\n\nMedical facilities and personnel\n\nMohammed Al Falahi, Secretary General of Red Crescent, UAE said that Hamas militants fired on Israeli planes from Red Crescent’s field hospital in order to provoke retaliation, attacked Red Crescent team on their way back and planted land mines on their path.\n\nIntimidation of journalists\n\nIsra al-Modallal, head of foreign relations for the Hamas Information Ministry, said Hamas did deport foreign journalists who filmed Hamas rocket launches, stating that by filming the launch sites the journalists were collaborating with Israel.\nHaaretz interviewed many foreign journalists and found “all but a few of the journalists deny any such pressure”. They said Hamas’s intimidation was no worse than what they got from the IDF, and said no armed forces would permit reporters to broadcast militarily sensitive information; and that, furthermore, most reporters seldom saw Hamas fighters, because they fought from concealed locations and in places that were too dangerous to approach.\n\nAlleged violations by Israel\nCivilian deaths\nWarnings prior to attacks\n\nAmnesty International and Human Rights Watch asserted that Israel was not providing effective warning according to international humanitarian law.\n\nAttacks on journalists\n\n17 journalists were killed in the conflict.\n\nThe IDF stated that in one case it had precise information that a vehicle marked “TV” that was hit killing one alleged journalist was in military use.\n\n\nDirector-General of UNESCO, Irina Bokova, who in August 2014 condemned the killing of Al Aqsa TV journalist Abdullah Murtaja, withdrew her comments after it was revealed that Murtaja was also a combatant in Hamas’s Al Qassam Brigade, and said she “deplored attempts to instrumentalize the profession of journalists by combatants”\n\nMilitary operations, weaponry and techniques\nGaza\nRockets\n\nAccording to the IDF, of all the 4,564 projectiles fired at Israel, 224 hit built-up areas, 735 were intercepted by the Iron Dome, 875 fell inside Gaza and the rest fell in open territory or failed to launch.\n\nEfforts to reconstruct Gaza\n\nAs of February 1st, 2015, only 125mil of the 2.7bil for reconstruction had been paid out, leaving tens of thousands of Gazans homeless.\nOnly one percent of the needed building material had been delivered.\nOn September 15th, 2014, a Fatah spokesperson accused Hamas of misappropriating $700 mil of funds intended to rebuild Gaza.\n\nOn January 6th, a Hamas spokesperson said the PNA redirected rebuilding funds to the PNA budget.\n\n\n"},"Research/Library/Events/2018.03.30-2019.12.27---Great-March-of-Return":{"title":"2018.03.30-2019.12.27 -

He suggested that Israel and the IDF would be powerless to stop so many peaceful activists and hoped Palestinian refugees from Jordan, Syria and Lebanon would join in as well.\n\n\n                  \n                  Ahmed Abu Artema on Facebook, January 7th, 2018\n                  \n                \n\n(using Google to translate from Arabic)\nWhat if two hundred thousand demonstrators went out in a peaceful march and stormed the barbed wire east of Gaza and entered our occupied territories for a few kilometers while raising Palestinian flags and the keys of return and accompanied by the international media, then they set up tents inside and established a city there, and let us call it the city of Bab al-Shams, and thousands of Palestinians from inside joined them? They insisted on remaining there peacefully without using any form of violence??\nWhat can the heavily armed occupation do to these peaceful human advances??\nWill he kill ten, twenty, or fifty of them? Then what will he do in the face of the relentless human encroachment??\nA people who want life and nothing more than life.\nNothing delays this idea except the self-fetters that we have woven from our illusions.\nWe are dying in our narrow, besieged place, so why don’t we flee before the knife slaughters us?\nThey are plotting to expel us to the south after killing us, so why don’t we go one step ahead of them and hasten to flee to the north?\nIf there must be a price, let this price be in the right direction, in the direction of returning to Palestine, in the direction of gaining new land and deepening the enemy’s existential predicament.\nWhen we implement this idea and it achieves a historical breakthrough, we will discover how many years we have wasted in hesitation and reluctance.\nRevolt, and you will lose nothing but shackles.\n\n\nDespite claims from the UN and other third parties, and despite the stated desires of Abu Artema, Hamas picked up on this protest almost immediately and started to organize heavily for the first demonstration on March 30th. Gazan bus drivers reported being threatened by Hamas in the beginning days of the protest to bus violent protestors to the front of the demonstrations.\n\n\n                  \n                  Ismail Hanyeh on April 9th, 2018 in a speech at the Malak protest site \n                  \n                \n\n“Here I am emphasizing more and more that the March is peaceful and I hope all the factions and our people understand the aim behind this March, we are leading this March with a lethal weapon, the weapon made of people and masses that we will use to knock over the doors of the occupation forces and open the doors of return and breaking the siege. Yes, at this time we emphasize the peacefulness of the March.” He underlined though that Hamas was still committed to armed resistance: “Our weapons are in our hands, our missiles in our hands, our tunnels are with us and the improvement of our resistance is ongoing by God’s will. This does not contradict that.” Later in the same speech Haniyeh said: “Yes we will break the walls of the blockade, we will remove the occupation entity, and we will return to all of Palestine’s land by God’s will.”\nWhile the majority of those who showed up to protest were peaceful, violent actions occurred almost every protest near the separation border between Gaza and Israel. This included organized groups of people bringing tires to the front and burning them to provide cover against the IDF sniper fire, dozens of young men slinging rocks towards the border fence, protestors sending incendiary kites and balloons across the fence into southern Israel, and occasionally militants making it up to and across the border to plant IEDs.\n\n\nThe IDF prepared in advance for the Great March of Return, dropping leaflets and warning the civilian population not to participate. Snipers were brought to the wall, organized in teams of two, requiring explicit permissions from a commander for every shot taken. The IDF employed a variety of non-lethal methods, including sandbag bullets, tear-gas, and loud speakers. They were also given instructions to shoot legs to reduce the overall fatality count by the end of the encounters.\nMultiple times throughout the first year of protests involved protestors getting up to the separation fence to begin cutting it, or to attach rope to it to pull away the barbed wiring. Palestinian journalists and medics were on standby to capture footage of any protestor shot by the IDF during the demonstrations, with the footage being broadcast to the world immediately to rally support for the Palestinians and anger against the Israelis. May 14th, one day before the anniversary of the Nakba, was one of the largest days and the early culmination of the protests, with some tens of thousands of protestors turning out on that day.\nBy the end of the first year of the demonstrations, the IDF killed 112 individuals. The IDF claimed that some 90 of these were positively identified as belonging to either Hamas, Fatah, PIJ, the DFLP or the PFLP, with 19 being of unknown origin. In the UN’s analysis of the first year, they concluded only a single fatality was justified, though they analyze the event as a policing event rather than an armed conflict event.\nThe protests would finally be formally brought to an end in December of 2019, with Hamas negotiating a ceasefire brokered by Egypt and UNSCO in exchange for fuel from Israel.\nOutcome\nNothing significant was achieved as a result of these protests, aside from more condemnation of Israeli’s violent response to Palestinian violence at the Gazan border.\nImportant Notes\n\nThe Great March of Return started off as a protest immediately utilized by Hamas for violent purposes to degrade the security of the Gaza-Israel separation border.\nThis event was largely seen by the rest of the world as a mostly peaceful protest, despite what actually occurred during the demonstrations, and served to turn the world increasingly against Israel.\n"},"Research/Library/Events/2021.05.06-2021.05-21---2021-Israel-Palestine-Crisis":{"title":"2021.05.06-2021.05-21 - 2021 Israel-Palestine Crisis","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Sources\n\nMain Source - Wikipedia Entry - 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis\n\nBackground\nApril–May 2021 Ramadan events\n\nAt the beginning of Ramadan in 2021, Israeli police entered Al-Aqsa Mosque and severed loudspeaker cables used to broadcast the muezzin’s ritual call to prayer.\nIn the same month, Israeli police closed the staired plaza outside the Old City’s Damascus Gate.\nViolent incidents occurred throughout Israel and the West bank, with rockets being fired into Israel from the Gaza strip\n\nSheikh Jarrah controversy\n\nApartments in East Jerusalem that were originally on land owned by Arabs (pre 1880’s) then Jews (post 1880’s) then Arabs (post 1948) then Jews (post 1967) were the subject of dispute when Israeli’s attempted to evict Palestinian residents.,\n\nPolitical instability\n\nMahmoud Abbas indefinitely postponed the May 22nd 2021 Palestinian legislative elections due to fear of his party, Fatah, losing the upcoming elections, prompting Hamas to resume rocket fire.\n\nEscalation\n\nBetween May 10th-14th, Israeli security forces injured approximately 1,000 Palestinian protestors in east Jerusalem over Sheikh Jarrah protests that eventually spread to al-Aqsa Mosque, Lod, and other Arab localities in Israel and the West Bank.\n\nSheikh Jarrah\n\nIsraeli settlers and far-right political party members of Otzma Yehudit clashed here.\n\nAl-Aqsa Mosque compound\n\nPolice clashed with worshippers at the al-Aqsa compound from May 7th-May 10th.\n\nWest Bank\n\nAfter Friday prayers on May 14th, to May 17th, police and protestors clashed, with protestors protesting in more than 200 locations.\n\nArab communities in Israel\n\nOn May 11th, Netanyahu declared a state of emergency in Lod, marking the first time since 1966 that Israel has used emergency powers over an Arab community.\n\nGaza\n\nHamas demand Israel remove all of its police and military from the Haram al Sharif mosque and Sheik Jarrah by May 10th.

Israeli sources reported the launch of 3,000 projects, killing 5.\nPalestinian militants also opened fire on Israeli boats off the Gaza Strip.\nAs the rockets were launching, about 2,900 militants invaded Israel via at least 30 different locations using ground vehicles, speedboats and powered paragliders.\nMultiple massacres unfolded at the Nova music festival, Nir Oz, Be’eri, Netiv HaAsara, Kfar Aza. An amphibious assault was carried out in Zikim, north of Gaza.\nThe majority of the attacks were carried out within a few hours, with some holdouts and fighting continuing through October 10th.\n\nHostages\n\nOn October 16th, Hamas claimed they were holding 250 hostages and had taken them to force Israel to release Palestinian prisoners.\n\nAlmost half the hostages were foreign nationals or held multiple citizenships.\n\n\nSome of these hostages were handed off to other groups.\n\nIntent to Harm Civilians\n\nThe IDF claimed to have recovered documents illustrating the intent of Palestinian fighters entering Israel on October 7th. 5\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Documents brought back from the Gaza Strip indicate that Hamas premeditated its atrocities against Israelis and to kidnap and maltreat them \n                  \n                \n\n\nThe Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, January 20th, 2024.\n\nThe documents indicate that violent attacks on civilians had been planned in advance. Training included careful preparations for attacking shelters to take hostages, stripping them and threatening to kill them while questioning them. The captured documents show profound anti-Semitism coupled with radical Islamist ideology of the type which characterizes extremist organizations such as ISIS and al-Qaeda.\n…\nDocument 1: A hand-written note calling for the brutal murder of Jews\nA handwritten note found in the pocket of a commander of the Izz al-Din Qassam Brigades,\nHamas’ military wing, who was one of the perpetrators of the terrorist attack and massacre\non October 7, 2023. He wrote it for his subordinates before he was killed near the border on\nthe Israel side, and it was apparently written to encourage them before the attack.\n…\nDocument 2: An Arabic-Hebrew phrasebook\nAmong the documents found was an Arabic-Hebrew phrasebook with Hebrew words and\nphrases transliterated into Arabic characters. The pamphlet was found in the possession of\nthe Jerusalem Battalion of the Izz al-Din Qassam Brigades, Hamas’ military wing, and was\napparently distributed to terrorists who participated in the October 7, 2023 attack and\nmassacre, who were supposed to use it. Its contents are shocking and testify to the\nterrorists’ intentions and plans, including attacking and humiliating civilians, stealing their\nvehicles, separating men, women and children, capturing and murdering civilians. Some\nof the Hebrew phrases are, “Take off your pants,” “Where is your weapon?” “I will kill you,”\n“You are a prisoner,” “Where is the head of the kibbutz?” “We have hostages,” “We will kill\nthe captives,” “Where are the car keys?” “Men are here,” “Women are here,” “The children\nare here,” “Take off your clothes,” “Where is the commander?”\n…\nDocument 3: Practice drills for kidnapping civilians\nA document seized by the IDF in one of the Hamas strongholds in the Gaza Strip revealed details of the preparations made by Hamas operatives prior to the terrorist attack and massacre in the cities, towns and villages near the Gaza Strip, indicating that the planning of the attack included locating the shelters to deliberately harm as well as kidnap civilians, including women, children and the elderly. The document includes a follow-up report on a platoon exercise carried out by Hamas operatives in preparation for the massacre as well as a review, apparently written by one of the commanders, about the operatives’ performance during the exercise. Among the criticisms it was written, “No thorough operation was carried out to increase the number of hostages (number of women, children, men…),” indicating that the terrorists planned to kidnap civilians.\n\n\nSexual Violence\n\nThere is strong evidence indicating widespread sexual violence occurred during the October 7th attacks. 2\nThe UN did an investigation related to sexual violence conducted by its own investigators and did not rely on any interrogations nor accounts collected by the Israeli intelligence bodies.\nMany different factors complicated the identification of sexual violence, including volunteers helping to expedite burial efforts, some misinterpretations of bodies discovered in certain positions, and bodies being burned beyond recognition.\nDue to the harsh level of scrutiny some survivors received after coming forward, further survivors were hesitant to come forward with their names or specific details attached.\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Mission report : official visit of the Office of the SRSG-SVC to Israel and the occupied West Bank : 29 January – 14 February 2024 \n                  \n                \n\n\nUN. Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, March 4th, 2024.\n\nThe complexity and modus operandi of the attacks, which seem to have occurred over three cumulative waves, appear to demonstrate a significant level of planning, coordination and detailed prior knowledge of the targets selected.\n…\nThese included limited survivor and witness testimony, limited forensic evidence due to the large number of casualties and dispersed crime scenes in a context of persistent hostilities; the loss of potentially valuable evidence due to the interventions of some inadequately trained volunteer first responders; the prioritization of rescue operations and the recovery, identification, and burial of the deceased in accordance with religious practices, over the collection of forensic evidence. Further, a significant number of the recovered bodies had suffered destructive burn damage, which made the identification of potential crimes of sexual violence impossible.\n…\nThe lack of trust by survivors of the 7 October attacks and families of hostages in national institutions and international organizations, such as the United Nations, as well as the national and international media scrutiny of those who made their accounts public, hindered access to survivors of the attacks, including potential survivors/victims of sexual violence.\n…\nBased on the information gathered by the mission team from multiple and independent sources, there are reasonable grounds to believe that conflict-related sexual violence occurred during the 7 October attacks in multiple locations across Gaza periphery, including rape and gang rape, in at least three locations.\n…\nAt the Nova music festival and its surroundings, there are reasonable grounds to believe that multiple incidents of sexual violence took place with victims being subjected to rape and/or gang rape and then killed or killed while being raped.\n…\nThe mission team also found a pattern of bound naked or partially naked bodies from the waist down, in some cases tied to structures including trees and poles, along Road 232.\n…\nWith respect to hostages, the mission team found clear and convincing information that some have been subjected to various forms of conflict-related sexual violence including rape and sexualized torture and sexualized cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and it also has reasonable grounds to believe that such violence may be ongoing.\n…\nIt must be noted that witnesses and sources with whom the mission team engaged adopted over time an increasingly cautious and circumspect approach regarding past accounts, including in some cases retracting statements made previously. Some also stated to the mission team that they no longer felt confident in their recollections of other assertions that had appeared in the media.\n…\nThe mission team reviewed incidents of alleged sexual violence related to hostages in Gaza. Based on the first-hand accounts of released hostages, the mission team received clear and convincing information that sexual violence, including rape, sexualized torture, and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment occurred against some women and children during their time in captivity and has reasonable grounds to believe that this violence may be ongoing.\n…\nBased on first-hand accounts of released hostages there are reasonable grounds to believe that female hostages were also subjected to other forms of sexual violence.\n…\nOverall, based on the totality of information gathered from multiple and independent sources at the different locations, there are reasonable grounds to believe that conflict-related sexual violence occurred at several locations across the Gaza periphery, including in the form of rape and gang rape, during the 7 October 2023 attacks. Credible circumstantial information, which may be indicative of some forms of sexual violence, including genital mutilation, sexualized torture, or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, was also gathered.\n…\nWith regards to the hostages, the mission team found clear and convincing information that some hostages taken to Gaza have been subjected to various forms of conflict-related sexual violence and has reasonable grounds to believe that such violence may be ongoing.\n\n\n\nOn April 25th, “Screams Before Silence” was released, where at least two different women detailed sexual violence they had been subjected to, with Agam Goldstein claiming that half the female hostages she came into contact with had been subjected to some sort of sexual violence.\n\nCasualty Number Revisions\n\nDue to the badly charred bodies, Israel began revising casualty counts after identifying some as Hamas fighters.\n\n”40 behead babies”\nOutcome\n\nIn response to these October 7th attacks, Israel launched Operation Swords of Iron and began the largest ever incursion into the Gaza Strip to eliminate Hamas and rescue the captured Israeli hostages.\n\nImportant Notes\n\nThis was the largest terrorist attack in the history of Israel, and the largest single-day casualty event in Jewish history since the Holocaust.\nThis attack had likely been planned for at least a year in advance, likely with significant help from Iran.\nThis attack was the inciting moment for the ensuing 2023.10.07-ongoing - Israel-Hamas War.\n\nViolations of LoAC\n\nHamas\n\nPrinciple of Distinction (Rule 1)\nViolence aimed at spreading terror (Rule 2)\nBooby-Trapping bodies (Rule 80)\nSexual violence (Rule 93)\nTaking hostages (Rule 96)\nMutilating bodies (Rule 113)\n\n\n"},"Research/Library/Events/2023.10.07-ongoing---Israel-Hamas-War":{"title":"2023.10.07-ongoing - Israel-Hamas War","links":["Research/Library/Geographics/Israel","Research/Library/People/Benjamin-Netanyahu","Research/Library/People/Yoav-Gallant","Research/Library/Geographics/Gaza-Strip","Research/Library/Governments/Hamas","Research/Library/Governments/Palestinian-Islamic-Jihad","Research/Library/Governments/Democratic-Front-for-the-Liberation-of-Palestine","Research/Library/People/Mohammed-Deif","Research/Library/People/Ismail-Haniyeh","Research/Library/People/Yahya-Sinwar","Research/Library/Events/2023.10.07---October-7th-Hamas-Attack","Research/Library/People/Antony-Blinken","Research/Library/People/Lindsey-Graham"],"tags":[],"content":"Sources\n\n“Daily Press Briefing by the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General | Meetings Coverage and Press Releases.” October 13th, 2023.\n“Gaza: Findings on October 17 al-Ahli Hospital Explosion | Human Rights Watch.” 2023.

NYT) reported that some 500 people were killed when Israel bombed al-Ahli Hospital.\nUpon further analysis of the strike, a crater in the parking lot of the hospital showed that the hospital was clearly not destroyed and the strike was highly unlikely to come from an Israeli missile. Human Rights Watch published on November 26th, 2023 that the explosion was likely from a Palestinian armed group and questioned the unusual death count reported by Hamas for the attack.\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Gaza: Findings on October 17 al-Ahli Hospital Explosion \n                  \n                \n\n\nHuman Rights Watch, November 26th, 2023\n\nAt 6:59 p.m. that day, a type of munition that Human Rights Watch has not been able to conclusively identify hit a paved area inside the hospital compound, between a parking lot and a landscaped area where many civilians congregated to seek safety from Israeli strikes. The Ministry of Health in Gaza reported that 471 people were killed and 342 injured. Human Rights Watch was unable to corroborate the count, which is significantly higher than other estimates, displays an unusually high killed-to-injured ratio, and appears out of proportion with the damage visible on site.\n…\nHuman Rights Watch investigated the explosion by reviewing publicly available photos and videos, analyzing satellite imagery, interviewing five witnesses to the incident and its aftermath, reviewing analyses published by other organizations, and consulting experts. The remote analysis assessed the explosion and the damage on site, as well as several possible trajectories of the objects visible on videos taken at the time of the attack, which also showed the moments before and after the explosion at the hospital.\n…\nHowever, the sound preceding the explosion, the fireball that accompanied it, the size of the resulting crater, the type of splatter adjoining it, and the type and pattern of fragmentation visible around the crater are all consistent with the impact of a rocket.\nEvidence available to Human Rights Watch makes the possibility of a large air-dropped bomb, such as those Israel has used extensively in Gaza, highly unlikely. The Israeli military has dropped thousands of such bombs across the Gaza Strip since October 7.\nA Hamas official said the remnants would “soon be shown to the world.” More than a month after the events, this has not happened. Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas leader and deputy minister in the Hamas-led Gaza governing authority, told the media on October 22 that “the missile has dissolved like salt in the water.… It’s vaporized. Nothing is left.” Human Rights Watch noted that substantial portions of munitions typically survive a detonation, even if parts of munitions are designed to break apart and may be made unrecognizable by thermal damage.\n\n\nIsrael bombing “safe zones”\n\nMany publications (the UNCHR, HRW, PBS, DOHA news, VOA News) suggested that Israel was ordering civilians to flee in only 24 hours, an impossible task given the number of people (over 1 million) that needed to flee northern Gaza.\n\nThis seems to originate from a statement published by the UN from Spokesman for the Secretary-General Stéphane Dujarric.\n\n\nMany have also suggested that Israel has engaged in bombing “safe zones” by bombing southern Gaza after directing civilians to flee there.\n\n\nOn October 13th, Israel warned some 1.1 civilians to flee northern Gaza via airdropped pamphlets from the IAF, and messages across social media in both Arabic and English.\nDespite claims to the contrary, there is no evidence that a 24 hour warning was actually ever officially given. Significant ground military operations in Gaza didn’t actually occur until the 27th of October, 2023.\nThere have not been any mutually agreed upon “safe zones” established in the Gaza Strip as Hamas has never made any attempt to assist Israel with establishing said zones. The only official safe zone that Israel has declared exempt from attack is Al-Mawasi on October 18th.\nThe IDF has claimed multiple times that Hamas has fired dozens of rockets, many of which fail, multiple times from Al-Mawasi, as early as December 9th.\nOn January 4th, Hamas claimed that an Israeli air-strike killed 14 people in a house in Al-Mawasi. Despite this claim, there appears to be no pictures, video evidence nor any other type of information relating to this strike, which is odd, given that this area has been declared a permanent safe zone by Israel.\n\nReduction in necessary food and medical supplies\n\nMany claim that a dramatic reduction in trucks going into the Gaza Strip means that an insufficient amount of humanitarian supplies (food, water, medicine, fuel) are making it into the Gaza Strip. Some put forth stronger claims that this reduction has been intentionally done by Israel to collectively punish the Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip.\nMultiple claims have been made about Gazans facing widespread famine or imminent starvation.\n\n“Israel-Gaza war: Half of Gaza’s population is starving, warns UN” - BBC, December 9th, 2023\n“Gaza on the brink as one in four people face extreme hunger” World Food Programme, December 20th, 2023\n“Gaza Deaths from Hunger Could Surpass Casualties of Airstrikes in Coming Weeks” - Mercy Corps, December 21st, 2023\n“UN agency says 40 percent of Gaza’s population ‘at risk of famine” - Al Jazeera December 28th, 2023\n“Half of Gazans Are at Risk of Starving, U.N.

Humanitarian aid is reaching the other side of the crossings into the Strip, but distribution is difficult for several reasons, including a lack of workers and drivers, a lack of people willing to serve as security forces for aid after recent strikes, accusations of Hamas stealing aid, and lack of safe routes deeper into northern Gaza.\nAs of April 1st, 32 people have starved to death, using the most favorable source of Hamas’ Gazan Health Ministry.\n\nAl-Shifa Hospital\n\nInternational media claimed Israel lacked proper justification for the raid into Al-Shifa Hospital on November 13th.\n\nThe hospital’s head of surgery, Dr. Marwan Abu Saada, said “We are civilians. I am a doctor-surgeon. We have medical staff, we have patients, and displaced people. Nothing else.”\n\n\n\n\nUnited States intelligence services agree with IDF services based on independently collected intel that the hospital was used by Hamas and PIJ to command forces and hold some hostages. The IDF showed a massive tunnel shaft at Gaza Hospital to reporters after initially taking it over.\nThe NYT did an analysis based on classified documents from the IDF, claiming that the intelligence suggested Hamas used the tunnel for cover, stored weapons inside and maintained a harden tunnel system beneath Al-Shifa.\nHaaretz did their own investigation of Al-Shifa after the IDF raid and agreed that the medical personal and operators must have known Hamas was operating out of the hospital.\nThe IDF released surveillance camera footage from Al-Shifa Hospital showing Hamas terrorists bringing a Nepali and Thai citizen there on October 7th, as well as footage of the hospital being utilized by Hamas militants.\nIsrael went in and raided Al-Shifa a second time on March 18th, with the raid lasting 14 days. Israel claims to have arrested 900 suspected militants, with more than 500 being identified as members of Hamas or PIJ, with some of the detained being “commanders and significant people” according to CNN.\n\nICJ Genocide Case\nwww.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m001yplc/hardtalk-joan-donoghue-former-president-of-the-international-court-of-justice\nUNRWA accusations of Hamas collaboration\nUNRWA Tunnel\nWorld Central Kitchen strike\nNasser Hospital mass graves discovery\nIsraeli “Kill Zones”\nAI Targeting\nBuilding Destruction Percentage\ntwitter.com/AviBittMD/status/1783542176607039916\nHamas selling food\nHumanitarian Pier Workers attacked\nwww.i24news.tv/en/news/israel-at-war/artc-exclusive-u-s-humanitarian-pier-attacked-during-construction-work-off-gaza-coast\nwww.politico.com/news/2024/04/25/gaza-terrorists-attack-israeli-pier-00154386\nHamas Human Shields\nCeasefires\nHind Rajab\nShooting of the 3 Israeli hostages\nMass Graves\ntwitter.com/GeoConfirmed/status/1784735589364859140\nThe Drone strike of the 4 walking men.\n”Flour massacre”\nICC Arrest Warrants\n\nICC Prosecutor Karim A.A.

Additional assets within Israel–such as docks in the ports of Ashdod and Haifa–could be used by the Palestinians so as to wrap up a deal that for all practical purposes could be tantamount to 100 per cent territory. Needless to say, the Jordan Valley, the mythological strategic asset sanctified by generations of Israeli generals, would be gradually handed over to full Palestinian sovereignty.–Jerusalem would be divided to create two capitals, Jerusalem and Al-Quds, along ethnic lines. What is Jewish would be Israeli and what is Arab would be Palestinian.–The Palestinians would have full and unconditional sovereignty on the Temple Mount, that is, Haram al-Sharif. Israel would retain her sovereignty on the Western Wall and a symbolic link to the Holy of Holies in the depths of the Mount.–With regard to refugees, it was stated that the Palestinians would have the right ‘to return to historical Palestine’ but with ‘no explicit right of return to the State of Israel’. They could be admitted to Israel in limited numbers and on the basis of humanitarian considerations, but Israel would retain her sovereign right of admission. Refugees could be settled, of course, in unlimited numbers not only in the Palestinian state, but also in those areas within Israel that would be handed over to the Palestinians in the framework of land swaps (the Palestinians were supposed to receive an Israeli territory equivalent to 3 per cent of the surface of the West Bank). In addition, a multibillion-dollar fund would be put together to finance a comprehensive international effort of compensation and resettlement that would be put in place.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo.

Our decision, at the height of the Palestinian Intifada, in the midst of sweeping opposition on the part of the army–it was almost tantamount to a coup d’état that the Chief of Staff, General Mofaz, should have gone public to criticise the government’s endorsement of the parameters as an ‘existential threat to Israel’–and strong reservations from the opposition and public opinion, was a daring decision of a government (then already a minority government) of peace that stretched itself to the outer limits of its legitimacy in order to endorse positions its opponents labelled as suicidal, and as being an affront to Jewish values and history. But Arafat lingered. He refused to respond. As usual, he resumed his journeys throughout the world as if he were the travelling Emperor Hadrian, in the hope of evading any decision: another meeting with Mubarak, one more trip to Ben-Ali, another trip to Jordan, a further meeting of the Arab foreign ministers, dozens of calls from world leaders from the President of China to the Grand Duke of Luxembourg urging the Palestinian leader to seize this last opportunity, to grab the historic moment.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo.

And so was the Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah. He was said to be shocked that Arafat had wasted such an opportunity and that he had lied about the President’s offer on Jerusalem. Arafat’s rejection of the peace parameters was a ‘crime’ not only against the Palestinians but against the entire region, concluded the Saudi ambassador in a long interview published in the New Yorker on 24 March 2002.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo.

But those that formed coherent blocs adjacent to the 1967 line were supposed to remain as such under Israel’s sovereignty. However, as the maps that the Palestinians produced at Taba showed, our interlocutors totally rejected the very concept of blocs and referred to the settlements more as isolated outposts that would have to be linked separately from each other to Israel. Israel could not accept such an approach for it contradicted her entire peace strategy, and the Palestinians not only knew it but have always accepted it. All the back-track channels, either official or freelance, ever conducted by Israelis and Palestinians before Taba and after, were based on the acceptance by the Palestinians of the principle of settlement blocs.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo.

Had the Palestinians agreed to stick to the letter and the spirit of the Clinton parameters there should have been no reason for such differences to exist, but Mr Sarid thought nevertheless that an attempt should be made to reach a compromise by going the extra mile towards meeting the reservations of the Palestinians. ‘Let us split the burden between us,’ he suggested; ‘two of the four issues pending will be solved according to your position, and two according to ours, which is, as you know, respectful of the Clinton parameters.’ But to no avail. The Palestinians remained unimpressed.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo. Scars of War, Wounds of Peace: The Israeli-Arab Tragedy.

diminishing asset, but because the Palestinians treated the parameters as non-committal, and insisted on changing and challenging them on each and every point.\n\n"},"Research/Library/Events/White-Paper-of-1939":{"title":"White Paper of 1939","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Research/Library/Events/Woodhead-Commission":{"title":"Woodhead

Iraq-trained Colonel Ahmad Thalaya led a revolt against Imam Ahmad bin Yahya.\nAhmad bin Yahya defeated the besiegers, publicly decapitating Ahmad Thalaya and then executing Emir Saif el Islam Abdullah, the 48 year old Foreign Minister who was to become the new leader under Thalaya’s demands.\nIn March of 1958, Ahmad bin Yahya’s son, Muhammad al-Badr, went to Damascus to tell Nasser that Yemen would adhere to the United Arab Republic, as long as Ahmad could keep his throne and power.\nIn 1959, while Ahmad went to Rome for medical treatments, fights between tribal chieftains erupted. When Ahmad returned, he decapitated one of his subjects and amputated the left hand and right foot of 15 others.\nImam Ahmad died on September 18th, 1962, and was succeeded by his son, Muhammad al-Badr, who appointed Colonel Abdullah Sallal, a known socialist and Nasserist, as commander of the palace guard.\n\n\nEgypt\n\nNasser had desired regime change in Yemen since 1957, and acted in January of 1962 by supporting the Free Yemen Movement.\nIn a desire to continue his pursuit of Arab nationalism, especially after the dissolution of the UAR in 1961, Nasser supported a regime change in Yemen by supporting Colonel Abdullah Sallal.\nNasser’s considerations for sending troops to Yemen may have included the following\n\nimpact of his support to the Algerian War of Independence from 1954–62\nSyria breaking up from Nasser’s UAR in 1961\ntaking advantage of a breach in British and French relations, which had been strained by Nasser’s support for the FLN in Algeria and primarily for his efforts to undermine the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO), which caused the downfall of the Iraqi monarchy in 1958\nconfronting imperialism, which Nasser saw as Egypt’s destiny\nguaranteeing dominance of the Red Sea from the Suez Canal to the Bab-el-Mandeb strait\nretribution against the Saudi royal family, whom Nasser felt had undermined his union with Syria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory\n\nCoup d’état\n\nPlot\n\nFour different plots were happening simultaneously\n\nLieutenant Ali Abdul al Moghny\nColonel Abdullah Sallal, which eventually merged into…\nThe Hashid tribal confederation\nSeveral young princes who wanted to get rid of al-Badr but not the imamate\n\n\nOn September 25th, 1962, Sallal gathered known leaders of the Yemeni nationalist movement and began enacting the coup.\n\n\nExecution\n\nBy late morning of September 26th, all areas of Sana’a were secured and the revolutionaries had achieved victory over al-Badr and his guards.\n\n\nCoup aftermath\n\nNasser sent Egyptian General Ali Abdul Hameed on September 29th to assess the situation.\nSallal gained control of Yemen and would be protected by a battalion of Egyptian special forces.\nal-Badr went to Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n\n\nDiplomatic Attempts\n- Teams\n- West Germany, The United Kingdom, The United States, and Jordan all supported al-Badr, the Imam.\n- Egypt, Italy, Yugoslavia and the USSR supported Sallal.\n- The US, under John F. Kennedy, tried to resolve the dispute while communicating with Nasser (Egypt), Faisal (Saudi Arabia), Hussein (Jordan) and Salla (Yemen). Nasser agreed to pull out, only if Jordan and Saudi Arabia also stopped their aggression, but Jordan and Saudi Arabia did not trust Egyptian intentions for the peninsula.\n- Sallal proclaimed he would follow Yemen’s international obligations, including respect for Britain’s Aden Protectorate, and Nasser promised a gradual withdrawal of its 18,000 man force, as long as Saudi Arabian and Jordanian forces retire from border regions.\n- On December 19th, 1962, the US recognized the Yemen Arab Republic, with the UN following the next day.\n- Britain, Iran, Turkey and most of western Europe did not recognize the republic, while West Germany, Italy, Canada, Australia, the remaining Arab governments, Ethiopia and the entire communist bloc did.\nOperation Hard-surface\n- The UN attempted to launch a mission based on the US National Security Council, in which a 25 mile demilitarized strip along the Saudi/Yemen border.\n- Egypt didn’t really want to withdraw its forces, and Saudi Arabia had already begun cutting back support for royalists due to the threat of a combined Syria/Iraq/Egypt.\n- On September 4th, 1964, the UN admitted failure and ended the mission.\nEgyptian offenses\n\nEgypt attempted to win an air war to substitute lack of ground power.\nEgypt also bought off and sent humanitarian aid to many tribal leaders in order to encourage them to be loyal to the new republican government.\n\n\nRamadan offensive\n\nIn February of 1963, Amer and Sadat arrived in Sana’a.\nAmer requested 20,000 additional men for Yemen.\nFighting ensued between the Egyptian forces and the royalist forces for the next few months, with the royalist and Egyptian forces pushing each other’s territory.\n\n\nHaradh offensive\n\nMore fighting.\n\n\nAlexandria summit and Erkwit ceasefire\n\nIn September of 1964, Faisal and Nasser met in an Arab summit in Alexandria, and agreed to reach a peaceful settlement to resolve the conditions in Yemen.\nOn November 4th, the Egyptians resumed their bombings of royalist positions, and the peace agreements fell through.\n\n\nRoyalist offensive\n\nMore fighting.\n\n\nStalemate\n\nLots of people dead on both sides.\nSallal fired his Premier, General Hassan Amri, and appointed a moderate, Ahmed Noman, in his place, in order to attempt to unite Yemen’s two main tribal groupings, the mountain Zaidi Shias (royalists), and the Shafi’i Sunnis (republicans).\n\n\nNasser’s “long-breath” strategy\n\nEgypt had run up a foreign debt of nearly $3b.\nNasser conceded they were facing difficulties, and raised a variety of taxes on the public to afford the war effort.\nNasser also supported Egyptian sabotage bombings in Saudi Arabia.\nOn May Day of 1966, Nasser said the war was entering the “long-breath strategy,” where he would draw down troops from 70k to 40k and simply focus on reinforcing tighter positions, withdrawing from exposed positions. He also insisted on attacks on Najran, Qizan and other “bases of aggression”, claiming they were originally Yemeni towns stolen by the Saudis in the 1930’s.\nNasser was warned by both the US and the USSR not to escalate the conflict into a hot war with Saudi Arabia.\nTunisia broke diplomatic relations with the republic, and Sallal’s government seemed on the verge of collapse.\n\n\nChemical warfare\n\nFrom 1963-1967 multiple gas attacks occurred against North Yemen villages, with claims that the Egyptians were behind the gas attacks.\nBy the end of July, 1967, 1,500 fatalities and 1,500 injuries were estimated among royalist Yemen villages.\n\n\nEgyptian Withdrawal\n\nAs part of the Khartoum Resolution, Egypt announced an end to the Yemen war.\nEgypt and Saudi Arabia revived their Jeddah agreement of 1965.\nSallal accused Nasser of betrayal.\nSallal rapidly lost popularity at home, firing and appointing an entirely new Cabinet. Nasser in November of 1965 would encourage him to resign and go into exile. Once Sallal refused and went to Baghdad, hoping to get support from other Arab Socialists, Nasser sent a cable of Sana’a instructing his troops there not to block an attempt at a coup.\n\n\nSiege of Sana’a\n\nThe royalists sieged the newly created republican government headed by Qadi Abdul Rahman Iryani, Armed Noman and Mohamed Ali Uthman. The royalists suffered due to Saudi Arabia no longer shipping them arms nor financing them after the Khartoum agreement, however.\n\n\nFinal Accords\n\nBy February of 1968, the seige was lifted and the republicans had won.\nThe British had withdrawn from South Yemen.\nTalks commenced and in 1970 Saudi Araba recognized the Republican and a ceasfire was effected.\n\n\n\n\n\n1967-1990 - The People’s Republic of South Yemen\n\nOn November 30th, 1967, the British pull out of Aden, leaving it under NLF control.\nIn June 1969, a Marxist wing of the NLF gained power and changed the country’s name to the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen, with all political parties on December 1st of 1970 combining into the Yemeni Socialist Party.\n\nThe PDRY established close ties with the Soviet Union, The PRC, Cuba and Palestine.\n\n\n\nYemenite War of 1972\n\nConflict between the Yemen Arab Republic (North Yemen, initially backed by Egypt, later Saudi Arabia) and the People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY, South Yemen, supported by Cuba, East Germany, North Korea and the USSR).\nSouth Arabian League rebels were attacking positions in eastern South Yemen, but were defeated by the South Yemen government on February 24th, 1972.\nPrime Minister Ali Nasir Muhammad survived an assassination attempt by SAL rebels on May 22nd, 1972.\nThe Cairo Agreement of 1972\n\nThe fighting only lasted 23 days with a swift victory by the South, supported by the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Iraq, Libya and Cuba, over the Yemen Arab Republic in the north, supplied by Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Iran and the United Kingdom/US.\n\n\n\nYemenite War of 1979\n\nConflict\n\nThe Marxist government of South Yemen was allegedly arming rebels through the National Democrat Front in North Yemen.\nOn February 24th, 1979, forces from North and South Yemen began firing at each other from across the border.\nMultiple attacks/excursions with air superiority were carried out by South Yemen.\nThe South was supported by Cuba, USSR, and East Germany.\nThe North, supported by Saudi Arabia, the United States, Iraq and Egypt, was eventually re-armed enough by 1983-84 to rebuild its military.\n\n\nKuwait Agreement of 1979\n\nOn March 20th, North and South Yemen called a bilateral ceasefire and met in Kuwait for reconciliation, pressured by Iraq/Syria and Kuwait, all calling for a unified Arab world in response to pressure from the Camp David Accords and the Iranian Revolution.\n\n\n\nSouth Yemen Civil War of 1986\n\nBackground\n\nThe National Liberation Front was handed power over the country following negotiations in Geneva with the British government.\nIsmael would go on to become the General Secretary after the NLF gained power over the country, adopting a Marxist-Leninist scientific socialism as the official state ideology.\nThe government supported Marxist paramilitary organizations around the Arabian Peninsula, including the PFLOAG and PFLO.\nThey supported the PFLO during the Dhofar Rebellion, in Oman.\nEventually, due to Ismail’s failures in Oman and during the Yemenite War of 1979, he resigned and went into exile, succeeded by Ali Nasir Muhammad, who favored less interventionalist.\nThe Soviet Union attempted to mediate from the naval base in Yemen which hosted 1,000-1,800 troops in 1986.\nIn 1985, the YSP politburo adopted a resolution stating political violence to settle political disputes was considered criminal.\n\n\nWar\n\nOn January 13th, 1986, bodyguards of Ali Nasir Muhammad opened fire on members of the YSP politburo as they were due to meet. The ensuing firefight caused multiple high ranking officials to die, including Abdul Fattah Ismail.\nAbdul Fattah Ismail came back, they fought for 12 days, he died.\nAli Nasir Muhammad and some 60,000 members of his brigade fled to the YAR.\n\n\nSuccession\n\nA former politburo member, al-Beidh, took the top position in the YSP following the 12-day civil war.\n\n\nAftermath\n\nSuffering a loss of more than half it’s USSR aid from 1986-1989, al-Beidh’s government worked towards unification with North Yemen.\n\n\n\nRepublic of Yemen\nUnification and transitional period\n\nThe Republic of Yemen was declared on May 22nd, 1990\n\nSaleh, the leader of YAR, became president\nal-Baidh, the leader of the PDRY, became vice president\n\n\nThe unity constitution was agreed upon in May of 1990, and ratified by the populace in 1991.\n\nIt affirmed Yemen’s commitment to free elections, a multiparty system, private property rights, equality under the law, and basic human rights.\n\n\nThe government ran into issues in 1993 after al-Bidh self-imposed exile to Aden in August 1993. Tribal conflicts escalated.\n\n1994 Civil War\n\nPolitical infighting continued, clashes intensified until civil war broke out in May 1994.\nMost of the fighting happened in the south, despite missile/air attacks against cities in the north.

Saleh invited Hussein al-Houthi to a meeting in Sana’a, but he declined and was killed on the 10th of September, 2004, by Saleh’s forces after a failed insurgency.\nThey participated in the 2011 Yemeni Revolution against Saleh’s administration.\nBy May 2012, Houthis were in control of three governorates and were erecting barricades north of Sana’a.\nBy September 2014, Houthis were said to control part of Sana’a.\nOn January 20th, 2015, Houthi rebels seized the presidential palace, then deposed the president and dissolved parliament on February 6th.\nOn the 20th of March, al-Badr and al-Hashoosh mosques came under suicide attack by ISIS, killing 142 Houthi worshippers and wounding more than 351, the deadliest terrorist attack in Yemen history.\nSaleh and the Houthi alliance broke down in late 2017, with the Houthis killing him on the 4th of December of the same year.\nOn January 17th, 2022, Houthi missile and drone attacks on UAE industrial targets killed 3 foreign workers. Saudi Arabia launched an airstrike on January 21st against a detention center in Yemen in response, killing at least 70.\n\nMembership and ranks\n\nThey have lots of people.\n\nIdeology\n\nThe Houthis have a wide variety of religious and political influences. They seem mainly to stand in opposition to the corruption of earlier governments, and will vary their alliances opportunistically.\nIn 2015, Newsweek reported that the Houthis are fighting for “for things that all Yemenis crave: government accountability, the end to corruption, regular utilities, fair fuel prices, job opportunities for ordinary Yemenis and the end of Western influence.”\nThe Houthis have rejected portrayals that they are trying to restore the old Zaydi imamate.\nSometimes the Houthis ally with Sunnis, other times they oppress them. :o\nThe Houthis have a very unique interpretation of Islam that puts them in conflict with the other sects of Islam, even other Shi’ites/Zaydi traditionalists.\nHouthis have fought with Salafis and later aligned with them depending on conditions. Originally they “crushed” the Salafi community/al-Qaeda presence in Saada Governate, but between 2014-2019 the Houthi leadership have signed multiple co-existence agreements with the Salafi community.\nThe Houthis have their own women security force and a Girl Scouts wing. Others claim that Houthis harass women and restrict their freedoms of movement and expression.\nNew York Times piece written about traveling to Yemen in 2018.\n\nLeaders\n\nHussein Badreddin al-Houthi – former leader (killed 2004)\nAbdul-Malik Badreddin al-Houthi – leader\nYahia Badreddin al-Houthi – senior leader\nAbdul-Karim Badreddin al-Houthi – high-ranking commander\nBadr Eddin al-Houthi – spiritual leader (died 2010)\nAbdullah al-Ruzami – former military commander\nAbu Ali Abdullah al-Hakem al-Houthi – military commander\nSaleh Habra – political leader\nFares Mana’a – Houthi-appointed governor of Sa’dah, and former head of Saleh’s presidential committee\n\nActivism and tactics\n\nThe Houthis have a “wide-tent” approach where they try to make fighting political corruption the center-piece of their political program.\nThe Houthis are said to have “a huge and well-oiled propaganda machine”. They have established “a formidable media arm” with the Lebanese Hezbollah’s technical support.\n\nArmed strength\n\nThe Houthis produce short-range ballistic missiles and launch them into Saudi Arabia.\nThey receive a lot of naval support and anti-naval weaponry from Iran, as well as converting many old Yemeni military ships to improvised explosive vessels.\n\nAlleged Iranian and North Korean support\n\nNorth Korea likely supplied the missiles launched towards Israel to the Houthis in January 2024.\nIran likely provides cash, weapons, ballistic missiles and training support for Houthis.\n\nAlleged human rights violations\n\nChildren as young as 13 have been arrested for “indecent acts” relating to homosexuality\nPeople are arrested for “political cases”\nMinors are housed with adult prisoners and are likely subject to rape.\nUNICEF claims that up to a third of all fighters in Yemen are comprised of child soldiers.\nUse of human shields.\nUse of hostage-taken for profits.\nThe UN World Food Program and the Norwegian Refugee Council both claim that the Houthis hamper food delivery to people on the brink of starvation.\nUN-funded investigators found evidence of sexual violence against young girls and the recruitment of boys as young as seven years old.\nUN Panel of Experts on Yemen discovered instances where Houthis would force women into prostitution for information gathering purposes.\n\nHouthi-controlled areas of Yemen\n\nAs of 2020, they control almost all of North Yemen.\n"},"Research/Library/Governments/Jewish-Agency-for-Palestine":{"title":"Jewish Agency for Palestine","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Research/Library/Governments/Jewish-National-Council":{"title":"Jewish National Council","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Research/Library/Governments/Jewish-National-Fund":{"title":"Jewish National Fund","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Research/Library/Governments/Military-Intelligence,-Section-6":{"title":"Military Intelligence, Section 6","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Research/Library/Governments/Muslim-Student-Followers-of-the-Imam's-Line":{"title":"Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Research/Library/Governments/Office-of-the-United-Nations-High-Commissioner-for-Refugees":{"title":"Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Research/Library/Governments/Organization-of-Arab-Petroleum-Exporting-Countries":{"title":"Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Research/Library/Governments/Palestine-Communist-Party":{"title":"Palestine Communist Party","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Research/Library/Governments/Palestine-Jewish-Colonization-Association":{"title":"Palestine Jewish Colonization Association","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Research/Library/Governments/Palestine-Land-Development-Company":{"title":"Palestine Land Development Company","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Research/Library/Governments/Palestine-Liberation-Organization":{"title":"Palestine Liberation Organization","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Research/Library/Governments/Palestinian-Authority":{"title":"Palestinian Authority","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Research/Library/Governments/Palestinian-Islamic-Jihad":{"title":"Palestinian Islamic Jihad","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Research/Library/Governments/Palestinians":{"title":"Palestinians","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo.

(p. 278)\n                  \n                \n\nAfter the Six Day War, however, the balance of forces in the war on public opinion clearly changed. Rarely–if ever–is history familiar with a similar case of a disparity between the high degree of international support enjoyed by a national movement and the poor results of such a support. In fact, after that war the overwhelming international support for the Palestinian cause almost became a handicap to the degree that it could be said that the Palestinians very nearly ‘suffered’ from an excess. At every junction of historical decision making, the international community gave them–and this is certainly true with regard to the Arab world–the sense that they were entitled to expect more and could therefore avoid a decision. The international pampering of the national Palestinian movement is unparalleled in modern history and, no less important, was at vital crossroads of the conflict an obstacle to a settlement. For it was frequently interpreted by the Palestinian leadership as an implicit encouragement to persist in its almost built-in incapacity to take decisions and find instead satisfaction in Israel’s decline into the position of a state put in the dock of the tribunal of international opinion."},"Research/Library/Governments/Popular-Front-for-the-Liberation-of-Palestine":{"title":"Popular Front

Scars of War, Wounds of Peace: The Israeli-Arab Tragedy. (p. 206)\n                  \n                \n\nAt that momentous crossroads, Arafat and the PLO misjudged the post-Cold War opportunities and failed to appreciate the far-reaching shift in the structure of international relations at the end of the Cold War. By supporting Saddam Hussein’s occupation of Kuwait they isolated themselves from the international and Arab worlds, especially from their wealthy patrons in the Gulf States, and lost their major sources of income without which, rhetoric apart, the PLO simply could not exist. Arafat’s miscalculations were of historic proportions, and they brought the Palestinian cause to the verge of financial and political bankruptcy. How could he not realise that by supporting the occupation of Kuwait he was morally spoiling his case, based since 1967 on the principle inherent in Security Council Resolution 242 about ‘the inadmissibility of the acquisition of land by force’? Arafat’s miscalculation in supporting Saddam Hussein can only be compared with the Mufti’s colossal blunder in throwing in his lot with Nazi Germany in World War Two. The crisis of the PLO boosted the chances of their rivals in the territories, especially the Islamic organisations Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which suffered no financial problems. Both Iran and Saudi Arabia continued to lavish budgets and gifts on them.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo. Scars of War, Wounds of Peace: The Israeli-Arab Tragedy. (p. 210)\n                  \n                \n\nArafat’s strategy was based on permanent negotiations, the desired outcome of which was never clear to him, nor was he ever able to spell it out so that the Israelis could weigh the final price they would have to pay to reach the end of the conflict. Arafat never managed, nor did he ever try, to convey to the Israelis that he had a sense of the finality of the conflict. Terror, including that perpetrated by Hamas, was to him a strategic weapon he used to soften the resistance of the Israelis. The Oslo accords had made available to him the conditions for waging a total war against Israel, and he would use them at the proper moment. At a Palestinian meeting in the West Bank town of Nablus in January 1996, just before an unprecedented wave of suicide terrorism brought about Shimon Peres’s electoral defeat to Benjamin Netanyahu, Nabil Shaath, a close associate of Arafat, explained the deeper meaning of Oslo from the PLO’s perspective. If the terms of the Palestinians for a settlement with Israel were not accepted, he said, We shall return to violence. But this time this will be done with 30,000 Palestinian soldiers at our disposal and while we control a territory of our own, and enjoy freedom and liberty … If we reach a dead end, we will resume the war and struggle exactly as we did forty years ago.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo. Scars of War, Wounds of Peace: The Israeli-Arab Tragedy.

In his rush to sideline the local leadership and stem the upsurge of Hamas, Arafat, his critics would say, agreed to turn the PLO from a national movement into the sheriff of a small, destitute ghetto in Gaza. Hamas and Jihad lost no time in unleashing a campaign of terror in the hope that this would lead to the radicalisation of Israeli public opinion and, consequently, to a shift to the right, which they expected would undermine and cripple Rabin’s peace policies. On the very eve of the signing of the DOP, three Israeli soldiers were slaughtered by a Hamas squad in Gaza. Suicide terrorism was not the invention of the second Intifada. It had already started in the euphoric days of Oslo. The day after the DOP was signed, on 14 September 1993, a Palestinian terrorist blew himself up in an Israeli police station in Gaza. But the bad omens for the future of Oslo did not come only from the Islamic opposition. On 11 May 1994, a week after he had signed the Cairo agreement establishing the modalities for Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho and a few days before he himself returned to an ecstatic reception in Gaza, Arafat called, in a speech behind closed doors in Johannesburg, for a Jihad to recover Jerusalem. He went to the extreme of comparing Oslo with the Prophet’s tactical Hudaybiyya agreement of AD 625 with the Qurayish tribe, an expedient peace that could be broken when the circumstances would warrant it. Though he liked to position himself as a Palestinian Mandela, or as the leader of a modern secular movement of national liberation, Arafat remained essentially loyal to his youth as a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and, as such, his real hero and model was the Mufti, Haj Amin al-Huseini, as he himself recognised in an interview with the Palestinian daily Al-Kuds of 2 August 2002.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Ben-Ami, Shlomo. Scars of War, Wounds of Peace: The Israeli-Arab Tragedy. (p. 214)\n                  \n                \n\nAs it turned out, the Johannesburg speech was not an isolated incident where Arafat simply got carried away. He uttered similar notions on other occasions. One such was a speech in Gaza’s al-Azhar University on the day celebrating the ascension of the Prophet to heaven, where he spoke again of Hudaybiyya as a ‘despised peace’. On another occasion, a meeting with an Arab audience in Stockholm as quoted by Yedidia Atlas from the Norwegian newspaper Dagen, Arafat presented the right of return and the demographic weapon as his way to subvert the spirit of the Oslo accords: ‘We of the PLO will now concentrate all our efforts on splitting Israel psychologically into two camps. … We will make life unbearable for the Jews by psychological warfare and population explosion.’ 1 This was to be Arafat’s mode of behaviour throughout the Oslo years. His was always the language of battle and Jihad. ‘We stand by our oath to pursue the battle,’ he promised in his speech at al-Azhar, where he also embraced the memory of Izzedin al-Qassam, the icon of Hamas’s struggle against the ‘Zionist entity’. He would never convey a clear message of peace and reconciliation to the Israeli public. A born master of double talk, he always preferred the language of ambiguities. Throughout his life as a terrorist and guerrilla leader, Arafat avoided an open confrontation with his rivals in the movement. He preferred to co-opt them. Holding the national movement together at all costs, shunning clear-cut divisive decisions, forever looking for leadership through consensus even when this meant not curbing the terrorist activities of those he had pledged to discipline in the Oslo accords–such was his disastrous and eventually self-defeating way of government throughout. An autocrat with no interest whatever in a modicum of good government or in policies of welfare and economic development, he was unable to create the necessary popular, democratic legitimacy for cracking down on Hamas.\n\n"},"Research/Library/People/Yigal-Allon":{"title":"Yigal Allon","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Research/Library/People/Yitzhak-Rabin":{"title":"Yitzhak Rabin","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Research/Library/People/Yitzhak-Shamir":{"title":"Yitzhak Shamir","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Research/Library/People/Yoav-Gallant":{"title":"Yoav Gallant","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Research/Library/People/Yossi-Beilin":{"title":"Yossi Beilin","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"www.youtube.com/watch"},"Research/Pop-Science/Biology/Brain-Development-Stops-at-25":{"title":"Brain Development Stops at 25","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"slate.com/technology/2022/11/brain-development-25-year-old-mature-myth.html"},"Research/Pop-Science/Biology/Drink-1-gallon-of-water-a-day":{"title":"Drink 1 gallon of water a day","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Research/Subjects/College-Degrees/College":{"title":"College","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"College\nGood Sources for Information\n\nNational Center for Education Statistics (NCES)\n\nThe National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) is the primary federal entity for collecting and analyzing data related to education.\n\n\nSocial Security Administration\n\nThe SSA collects a ton of data about a variety of different metrics related to income throughout a person’s life.\n\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics\n\nCollects data about the entirety of the US work force.\n\n\n\nHow Expensive is a College Degree?\nCost of Attendance Tables from the National Center for Education Statistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOST OF ATTENDANCEOn campusOff campus, living with familyOff campus, not living with family4-year institutionsPublic$26,027$15,552$26,756Private nonprofit$55,840$43,945$56,054Private for-profit$32,895$23,391$31,9092-year institutionsPublic$16,090$9,845$20,091Private nonprofit$33,007$23,686$33,560Private for-profit$27,214$21,395$31,370\n\nAverage total cost of attending degree-granting institutions for first-time, full-time undergraduate students, by level and control of institution and student living arrangement: Academic year 2021–22 (In constant 2021-2022 dollars)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTUITION AND FEES2010–112021–224-year institutionsPublic$9,138$9,678Private nonprofit$33,979$38,768Private for-profit$19,379$17,8252-year institutionsPublic$3,506$3,970Private nonprofit$17,644$17,735Private for-profit$17,800$15,637\n\nAverage tuition and fees of degree-granting institutions for first-time, full-time undergraduate students, by level and control of institution: Academic years 2010–11 and 2021–22 (In constant 2021-2022 dollars)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel of institutionPublicPrivate nonprofitPrivate for-profit4-year institutions$14,708$28,418$24,6012-year institutions$8,391$20,753$24,279\n\nAverage net price for first-time, full-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students awarded Title IV aid, by level and control of institution: Academic year 2020–21 (In constant 2021-2022 dollars)\n\nQuick Facts for College Costs\n\n$26,000/year is the average cost paid per year to live on campus with no financial aid for a bachelor’s degree.\nThe average cost, with financial aid factored in, is about $14,700/year for a bachelor’s degree.\nAbout 80% of undergraduate students enrolling in college for the first time attend college at an in-state university.

Women with bachelor&#039;s degrees earn 630,000 more. Men with graduate degrees earn 1.5 million more in median lifetime earnings than high school graduates. Women with graduate degrees earn 1.1 million more.\nApplying a 4 percent annual real discount rate, the net present lifetime value at age 20 of a bachelor’s degree relative to a high school diploma is 260,000 for men and 180,000 for women. For those with a graduate degree, it is 400,000 for men and 310,000 for women.\n\n\nEven getting an Arts degree confers a decent wage premium (25%) over just high school work.\nPeople who graduate college may have issues with underemployment, but they still enjoy significant wage premiums even when taking that into account.\n\nAre Trades Superior to Bachelor Degrees?\nQuick Facts for Trades vs Bachelor’s Degrees\n\nTrades don’t seem to out-earn Bachelor degrees at all.

In 2021 the BLS reported that the foreign-born LFP rate was 64.7% compared to 61% for the native-born.\n\nPolitical Impact\nCulture\nCrime\n\nCrimes rates seem to be higher for native born US citizens, even white US born citizens, than any other class of immigrants coming into the United States. This is especially due to white US-born men with no education having an incredibly high tendency to commit crime, something that poor and uneducated immigrants appear to be shielded from.\n\n\n\n                  \n                  LAW-ABIDING IMMIGRANTS: THE INCARCERATION GAP BETWEEN IMMIGRANTS AND THE US-BORN, 1870–2020 \n                  \n                \n\nWe construct the first nationally representative series of immigrant-US-born incarceration gaps from 1870 until present day. We find that, as a group, immigrant men have had a lower incarceration rate than US-born men for the last 150 years of American history. The differences in incarceration have become more pronounced starting in 1960, with recent waves of immigrants being 50–60% less likely to be incarcerated than US-born men (30% when compared to US-born white men). This relative decline in incarceration has occurred among immigrants from all major countries of origin, and it cannot be explained by changes in immigrants’ observable characteristics or in immigration policies. Moreover, we show that the divergence in outcomes between less-educated immigrants and US-born men occurred along dimensions beyond incarceration, including labor force participation and family formation rates\n\nRan Abramitzky et al.\nNBER Working Paper\nJuly 2023, Revised March 2024\n\n\n\nIllegal Immigration\nTypes of Illegal Immigration\n\nThree main types of unauthorized immigrants.\n\nMigrants who enter the United States without inspection.\nMigrants who overstay a period of lawful admission (overstays).\nMigrants who violated the terms of their admission.\n\n\nWhile the majority of the total unauthorized population are people who entered without inspection, in recent years overstays have accounted for the majority of the newly unauthorized population. For example, an analysis of unauthorized migration from 2010 to 2017 found that the majority of individuals who became unauthorized during that period were overstays. An estimated 46% of the total unauthorized population in 2017 were overstays. The proportion of overstays has increased primarily because EWIs began to decline after 2000.\n\nNumber of Illegal Immigrants\nTable from Unauthorized Immigrants: Frequently Asked Questions, Congressional Research Service, August 10th, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimate SourceEstimateYearData Source(s)Center for Immigration Studies11.35 million2022Current Population Survey (CPS); DHS and other administrative dataCenter for Migration Studies New York10.3 million2019ACS; DHS administrative dataCongressional Budget Office11.0 million2018CPS; DHS administrative dataMigration Policy Institute11.0 million2019ACS; Survey of Income Participation; DHSadministrative dataPew Research Center10.5 million2017ACS; DHS administrative dataU.S. Department of Homeland Security11.4 million2018ACS; DHS and other administrative data\nPew Research on Number of Illegal Immigrants in the US\nSource - What we know about unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S.\n\nEligibility for Federal/State aid\n\nIllegal immigrants are not eligible for most federal benefits, including non-emergency Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and most housing assistance programs.\nIllegal immigrants are eligible for: emergency Medicaid, short-term, in-kind disaster relief, immunization against and treatment for communicable diseases, and other random programs designated by Title IV of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996.\nIllegal immigrants are not eligible for federal student aid. Some states or local areas may provide student aid, based on their local rules.\nAs of 2021, illegal immigrants are eligible for driver’s licenses in 16 states, DC, and Puerto Rico.\n\nIllegal immigrants should not be able to be granted a REAL ID, due to federal requirements of status verification.\n\n\n\nWork Authorization\n\nIllegal immigrants generally are not eligible to apply for work authorization. Some cases are exceptions to this, e.g. DACA, TPS, DED or asylum seeking immigrants after 150 days from filing for asylum.\n\nVoting/Military Service\n\nOnly U.S. citizens are allowed to vote in federal elections. Noncitizens may vote in non-federal elections as authorized by states and localities.\nIllegal immigrants are not generally allowed to service in the military.\n\nEconomics\n\nIllegal immigrants have higher LFP rates than native or foreign-born populations, with 2019 estimates ranging from 69%-77%.\nIllegal immigrants tend to work in certain industries, such as agriculture, construction, leisure/hospitality, services, and manufacturing.\n\nDepartment of Labor survey of U.S. farmworkers in FY2019-FY2020 found that 44% of hired crop workers were unauthorized.\n\n\nA 2017 summary report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine claim that measuring illegal immigrant impact on wages is difficult. If wages are negatively impacted, it’s most likely concentrated on low skill jobs where illegal immigrants are competing directly with natives or recent immigrants, especially among those with no job skills and only some high school (or less) education.\nAccording to the same NASEM summary, it’s hard to determine the exact fiscal impact of illegal immigrants. It’s possible they could overconsume on state/local budgets for things like school, while under-consuming on federal budgets since they are generally of working age but aren’t eligible for most federal benefits.\nThe IRS and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration believe that a large proportion of Individual Taxpayer Identification Number filers are illegal immigrants working in the US.\n\nCrime\n\nIllegal immigrants seem to commit less crime than native or legal foreign-born populations.\n\nResearch done by Michael T. Light et al., Undocumented Immigration, Drug Problems, and Driving Under the Influence in the United States, 1990–2014 (published in 2017 in the American Journal of Public Health), finds that “increased undocumented immigration was significantly associated with reductions in drug arrests, drug overdose deaths, and DUI arrests, net of other factors. There was no significant relationship between increased undocumented immigration and DUI deaths.”\nIn another study by Michael T. Light and T Y Miller, DOES UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRATION INCREASE VIOLENT CRIME? (published in 2017 in Criminology), finds “the results from fixed-effects regression models reveal that undocumented immigration does not increase violence. Rather, the relationship between undocumented immigration and violent crime is generally negative, although not significant in all specifications.”\n\n\n\nPathway to Permanent Status\n\nThose who have entered the country illegally cannot adjust to LPR status since they have not been admitted legally into the US.\nThose who overstay visas or have otherwise failed to maintain their lawful status since entering the US are also ineligible for status adjustment.\nSome LPR pathways are available if you are seeking asylum.\n\nRandom Facts\n\nIllegal immigrants represent ~23%-26% of the 44.1 million foreign-born people living in the US.\nThe number of illegal immigrants in the US likely peaked in 2007, and the population has since either declined or stabilized.\nCategories of illegal immigrants who have protected status against deportation. These categories are counted for illegal immigrants.\n\nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)\n\nAs of March 2022, there were approximately 611,270 active DACA recipients.\n\n\nTemporary Protected Status (TPS)\n\nAs of February 2022, 354,625 individuals from 12 countries had TPS.\n\n\nDeferred Enforced Departure (DED)\n\nCertain Liberians and residents of Hong Kong present in the United States currently maintain relief under DED.\nIndividuals covered by DED are not required to register for the status with USCIS unless they are applying for work authorization. As a result, USCIS does not maintain data on the total population covered by DED\n\n\n\n\nAs of 2019, ~60% of illegal immigrants had lived in the US for at least a decade. ~22% had lived in the US for 20 years or more. ~23% had lived in the US for fewer than 5 years.\nAs of 2019, ~45% of illegal immigrants aged 15+ were married, with 41% of those having an LPT or citizen spouse. About 41% of unauthorized immigrants ages 15+ lived with at least one child under 18. 81% of this group lived with at least one child who was a US citizen. 5.2 million children under 18 (7% of the total US child population) lived with at least one illegal immigrant parent, with 85% of those children being US citizens.\nNon-citizens who stay in the US illegally for 6-12 months are inadmissible into the US for 3 years, and those unlawfully present for more than 1 year are inadmissible for 10 years.\n\nWaivers are available for those who are the spouse, son, or daughter of a U.S. citizen or LPR if “refusal of admission to such immigrant alien would result in extreme hardship to the citizen or lawfully resident spouse or parent of such alien.\n\n\nAn estimated 9.2 million LPRs are eligible for naturalization but have not done so.\n\nRemoval\n\nNoncitizens may be removed through different processes, including the following\n\nwhen an immigration judge issues an order of removal during formal removal proceedings\nunder expedited removal, in which arriving aliens100 and migrants who recently entered the United States without inspection may be removed by DHS without formal proceedings in immigration court\nunder reinstatement of final removal orders for noncitizens who have re-entered the United States without authorization after a previous removal or voluntary departure\nunder administrative removal for noncitizens convicted of an aggravated felony who did not have LPR status when their removal proceedings commenced.\n\n\nThe removal process begins when noncitizens are issued a Notice to Appear (NTA) charging document and it is filed with an immigration court.\nAs of June 2022, ~1.8 million noncitizens were in removal proceedings in immigrations, a large percentage of whom were illegal immigrants.\n\n~1.1million were charged with entry without inspection, and 663,000 were charged with another immigration infraction.\n\n\nNationwide Illegal Alien Apprehensions FY 1925-2019 from the US Border Patrol\nBloomberg opinion piece by Justin Fox, March 20th, 2024 “Illegal US Border Crossings Aren’t Really Breaking Records”\n\nAsylum seeking illegals are unique and overwhelming current the US immigration courts.\n\n\n\nBorder Security\nEllis Island\nCurrent Events\n\nHow to Fix America’s Immigration Crisis January 9th, 2024, by Steven Rattner and Maureen White\n"},"Research/Subjects/International-Law/International-Law":{"title":"International Law","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Geneva Conventions\nConvention (I) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field.

Indiscriminate attacks are:\n\nthose which are not directed at a specific military objective;\nthose which employ a method or means of combat which cannot be directed at a specific military objective; or\n those which employ a method or means of combat the effects of which cannot be limited as required by this Protocol; and consequently, in each such case, are of a nature to strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction.\n\n\nAmong others, the following types of attacks are to be considered as indiscriminate:\n\nan attack by bombardment by any methods or means which treats as a single military objective a number of clearly separated and distinct military objectives located in a city, town, village or other area containing a similar concentration of civilians or civilian objects; and\nan attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.\n\n\nAttacks against the civilian population or civilians by way of reprisals are prohibited.\nThe presence or movements of the civilian population or individual civilians shall not be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations, in particular in attempts to shield military objectives from attacks or to shield, favour or impede military operations.

The parties to the conflict must at all times distinguish between civilians and combatants. Attacks may only be directed against combatants. Attacks must not be directed against civilians.\n\nPractice\n\nVolume II, Chapter 1, Section A.\n\n\nSummary\n\nState practice establishes this rule as a norm of customary international law applicable in both international and non-international armed conflicts. The three components of this rule are interrelated and the practice pertaining to each of them reinforces the validity of the others. The term combatant in this rule is used in its generic meaning, indicating persons who do not enjoy the protection against attack accorded to civilians, but does not imply a right to combatant status or prisoner-of-war status (see Chapter 33).This rule has to be read in conjunction with the prohibition to attack persons recognized to be hors de combat (see Rule 47) and with the rule that civilians are protected against attack unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities (see Rule 6). Belligerent reprisals against civilians are discussed in Chapter 41.\n\n\nInternational armed conflicts\n\nThe principle of distinction between civilians and combatants was first set forth in the St. Petersburg Declaration, which states that “the only legitimate object which States should endeavour to accomplish during war is to weaken the military forces of the enemy”. The Hague Regulations do not as such specify that a distinction must be made between civilians and combatants, but Article 25, which prohibits “the attack or bombardment, by whatever means, of towns, villages, dwellings, or buildings which are undefended”, is based on this principle. The principle of distinction is now codified in Articles 48, 51(2) and 52(2) of Additional Protocol I, to which no reservations have been made. According to Additional Protocol I, “attacks” means “acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or in defence”. At the Diplomatic Conference leading to the adoption of the Additional Protocols, Mexico stated that Articles 51 and 52 of Additional Protocol I were so essential that they “cannot be the subject of any reservations whatsoever since these would be inconsistent with the aim and purpose of Protocol I and undermine its basis”. Also at the Diplomatic Conference, the United Kingdom stated that Article 51(2) was a “valuable reaffirmation” of an existing rule of customary international law. The prohibition on directing attacks against civilians is also laid down in Protocol II, Amended Protocol II and Protocol III to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons and in the Ottawa Convention banning anti-personnel landmines. In addition, under the Statute of the International Criminal Court, “intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population as such or against individual civilians not taking direct part in hostilities” constitutes a war crime in international armed conflicts. Numerous military manuals, including those of States not, or not at the time, party to Additional Protocol I, stipulate that a distinction must be made between civilians and combatants and that it is prohibited to direct attacks against civilians. Sweden’s IHL Manual identifies the principle of distinction as laid down in Article 48 of Additional Protocol I as a rule of customary international law. In addition, there are numerous examples of national legislation which make it a criminal offence to direct attacks against civilians, including the legislation of States not, or not at the time, party to Additional Protocol I. In the Kassem case in 1969, Israel’s Military Court at Ramallah recognized the immunity of civilians from direct attack as one of the basic rules of international humanitarian law. There are, moreover, many official statements which invoke the rule, including by States not, or not at the time, party to Additional Protocol I. The rule has also been invoked by parties to Additional Protocol I against non-parties. In their pleadings before the International Court of Justice in the Nuclear Weapons case, many States invoked the principle of distinction. In its advisory opinion in the Nuclear Weapons case, the Court stated that the principle of distinction was one of the “cardinal principles” of international humanitarian law and one of the “intransgressible principles of international customary law”. When the ICRC appealed to the parties to the conflict in the Middle East in October 1973, i.e., before the adoption of Additional Protocol I, to respect the distinction between combatants and civilians, the States concerned (Egypt, Iraq, Israel and Syria) replied favourably.\n\n\nNon-international armed conflicts\n\nArticle 13(2) of Additional Protocol II prohibits making the civilian population as such, as well as individual civilians, the object of attack. The prohibition on directing attacks against civilians is also contained in Amended Protocol II to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. It is also set forth in Protocol III to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, which has been made applicable in non-international armed conflicts pursuant to an amendment of Article 1 of the Convention adopted by consensus in 2001. The Ottawa Convention banning anti-personnel landmines states that the Convention is based, inter alia, on “the principle that a distinction must be made between civilians and combatants”. Under the Statute of the International Criminal Court, “intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population as such or against individual civilians not taking direct part in hostilities” constitutes a war crime in non-international armed conflicts. In addition, this rule is included in other instruments pertaining also to non-international armed conflicts. Military manuals which are applicable in or have been applied in non-international armed conflicts specify that a distinction must be made between combatants and civilians to the effect that only the former may be targeted. To direct attacks against civilians in any armed conflict is an offence under the legislation of numerous States. There are also a number of official statements pertaining to non-international armed conflicts invoking the principle of distinction and condemning attacks directed against civilians. States’ submissions to the International Court of Justice in the Nuclear Weapons case referred to above were couched in general terms applicable in all armed conflicts. No official contrary practice was found with respect to either international or non-international armed conflicts. This rule is sometimes expressed in other terms, in particular as the principle of distinction between combatants and non-combatants, whereby civilians who do not take a direct part in hostilities are included in the category of non-combatants. Alleged violations of this rule have generally been condemned by States, irrespective of whether the conflict was international or non-international. Similarly, the UN Security Council has condemned or called for an end to alleged attacks against civilians in the context of numerous conflicts, both international and non-international, including in Afghanistan, Angola, Azerbaijan, Burundi, Georgia, Lebanon, Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Tajikistan, the former Yugoslavia and the territories occupied by Israel. As early as 1938, the Assembly of the League of Nations stated that “the intentional bombing of civilian populations is illegal”. The 20th International Conference of the Red Cross in 1965 solemnly declared that governments and other authorities responsible for action in all armed conflicts should conform to the prohibition on launching attacks against a civilian population. Subsequently, a UN General Assembly resolution on respect for human rights in armed conflicts, adopted in 1968, declared the principle of distinction to be applicable in all armed conflicts. The Plan of Action for the years 2000–2003, adopted by the 27th International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent in 1999, requires that all parties to an armed conflict respect “the total ban on directing attacks against the civilian population as such or against civilians not taking a direct part in hostilities”. In a resolution adopted in 2000 on protection of civilians in armed conflicts, the UN Security Council reaffirmed its strong condemnation of the deliberate targeting of civilians in all situations of armed conflict. The jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice in the Nuclear Weapons case, of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, in particular in the Tadić case, Martić case and Kupreškić case, and of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in the case relative to the events at La Tablada in Argentina provides further evidence that the obligation to make a distinction between civilians and combatants is customary in both international and non-international armed conflicts. The ICRC has called on parties to both international and non-international armed conflicts to respect the distinction between combatants and civilians.\n\n\n\n\nRule 6 - Civilians’ Loss of Protection from Attack\nRule 6. Civilians are protected against attack, unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities.\n\nPractice\n\nVolume II, Chapter 1, Section F.\n\n\nSummary\n\nState practice establishes this rule as a norm of customary international law applicable in both international and non-international armed conflicts. The use of human shields is the subject of Rule 97.\n\n\nInternational armed conflicts\n\nThe rule whereby civilians lose their protection against attack when and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities is contained in Article 51(3) of Additional Protocol I, to which no reservations have been made. At the Diplomatic Conference leading to the adoption of the Additional Protocols, Mexico stated that Article 51 of Additional Protocol I was so essential that it “cannot be the subject of any reservations whatsoever since these would be inconsistent with the aim and purpose of Protocol I and undermine its basis”. Also at the Diplomatic Conference, the United Kingdom stated that the exception to the civilian immunity from attack contained in Article 51(3) was a “valuable reaffirmation” of an existing rule of customary international law. Upon ratification of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, the United Kingdom declared that civilians enjoyed the protection of the Convention “unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities”.\nNumerous military manuals state that civilians are not protected against attack when they take a direct part in hostilities. The rule is supported by official statements and reported practice. This practice includes that of States not, or not at the time, party to Additional Protocol I. When the ICRC appealed to the parties to the conflict in the Middle East in October 1973, i.e., before the adoption of Additional Protocol I, to respect civilian immunity from attack, unless and for such time as they took a direct part in hostilities, the States concerned (Egypt, Iraq, Israel and Syria) replied favourably.\n\n\nNon-international armed conflicts\n\nPursuant to Article 13(3) of Additional Protocol II, civilians are immune from direct attack “unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities”. In addition, this rule is set forth in other instruments pertaining also to non-international armed conflicts.\nThe rule that civilians are not protected against attack when they take a direct part in hostilities is included in many military manuals which are applicable in or have been applied in non-international armed conflicts.\nIn the case concerning the events at La Tablada in Argentina, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights held that civilians who directly take part in fighting, whether singly or as members of a group, thereby become legitimate military targets but only for such time as they actively participate in combat.\nTo the extent that members of armed opposition groups can be considered civilians (see commentary to Rule 5), this rule appears to create an imbalance between such groups and governmental armed forces. Application of this rule would imply that an attack on members of armed opposition groups is only lawful for “such time as they take a direct part in hostilities” while an attack on members of governmental armed forces would be lawful at any time. Such imbalance would not exist if members of armed opposition groups were, due to their membership, either considered to be continuously taking a direct part in hostilities or not considered to be civilians.\nIt is clear that the lawfulness of an attack on a civilian depends on what exactly constitutes direct participation in hostilities and, related thereto, when direct participation begins and when it ends. As explained below, the meaning of direct participation in hostilities has not yet been clarified. It should be noted, however, that whatever meaning is given to these terms, immunity from attack does not imply immunity from arrest and prosecution.\n\n\nDefinition\n\nA precise definition of the term “direct participation in hostilities” does not exist. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has stated that the term “direct participation in hostilities” is generally understood to mean “acts which, by their nature or purpose, are intended to cause actual harm to enemy personnel and matériel”. Loss of protection against attack is clear and uncontested, as evidenced by several military manuals, when a civilian uses weapons or other means to commit acts of violence against human or material enemy forces.But there is also a lot of practice which gives little or no guidance on the interpretation of the term “direct participation”, stating, for example, that the assessment of direct participation has to be made on a case-by-case basis or simply repeating the general rule that direct participation causes civilians to lose protection against attack. The military manuals of Ecuador and the United States give several examples of acts constituting direct participation in hostilities, such as serving as guards, intelligence agents or lookouts on behalf of military forces. The Report on the Practice of the Philippines similarly considers that civilians acting as spies, couriers or lookouts lose their protection against attack.\nIn a report on human rights in Colombia, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights sought to distinguish “direct” from “indirect” participation:\n\nCivilians whose activities merely support the adverse party’s war or military effort or otherwise only indirectly participate in hostilities cannot on these grounds alone be considered combatants. This is because indirect participation, such as selling goods to one or more of the armed parties, expressing sympathy for the cause of one of the parties or, even more clearly, failing to act to prevent an incursion by one of the armed parties, does not involve acts of violence which pose an immediate threat of actual harm to the adverse party.\n\n\nThe distinction between direct and indirect participation had previously been developed by the Special Representative of the UN Commission on Human Rights for El Salvador. It is clear, however, that international law does not prohibit States from adopting legislation that makes it a punishable offence for anyone to participate in hostilities, whether directly or indirectly.\nThe Report on the Practice of Rwanda makes a distinction between acts that constitute direct participation in international and non-international armed conflicts and excludes logistical support in non-international armed conflicts from acts that constitute direct participation. According to the responses of Rwandan army officers to a questionnaire referred to in the report, unarmed civilians who follow their armed forces during an international armed conflict in order to provide them with food, transport munitions or carry messages, for example, lose their status as civilians. In the context of a non-international armed conflict, however, unarmed civilians who collaborate with one of the parties to the conflict always remain civilians. According to the report, this distinction is justified by the fact that in internal armed conflicts civilians are forced to cooperate with the party that holds them in its power.\nIt is fair to conclude, however, that outside the few uncontested examples cited above, in particular use of weapons or other means to commit acts of violence against human or material enemy forces, a clear and uniform definition of direct participation in hostilities has not been developed in State practice.\nSeveral military manuals specify that civilians working in military objectives, for example, munitions factories, do not participate directly in hostilities but must assume the risks involved in an attack on that military objective. The injuries or death caused to such civilians are considered incidental to an attack upon a legitimate target which must be minimized by taking all feasible precautions in the choice of means and methods, for example, by attacking at night (see Rule 17). The theory that such persons must be considered quasi-combatants, liable to attack, finds no support in modern State practice.\n\n\nSituations of doubt as to the character of a person\n\nThe issue of how to classify a person in case of doubt is complex and difficult. In the case of international armed conflicts, Additional Protocol I has sought to resolve this issue by stating that “in case of doubt whether a person is a civilian, that person shall be considered to be a civilian”. Some States have written this rule into their military manuals. Others have expressed reservations about the military ramifications of a strict interpretation of such a rule. In particular, upon ratification of Additional Protocol I, France and the United Kingdom expressed their understanding that this presumption does not override commanders’ duty to protect the safety of troops under their command or to preserve their military situation, in conformity with other provisions of Additional Protocol I. The US Naval Handbook states that:\n\nDirect participation in hostilities must be judged on a case-by-case basis. Combatants in the field must make an honest determination as to whether a particular civilian is or is not subject to deliberate attack based on the person’s behavior, location and attire, and other information available at the time.\n\n\nIn the light of the foregoing, it is fair to conclude that when there is a situation of doubt, a careful assessment has to be made under the conditions and restraints governing a particular situation as to whether there are sufficient indications to warrant an attack. One cannot automatically attack anyone who might appear dubious.\nIn the case of non-international armed conflicts, the issue of doubt has hardly been addressed in State practice, even though a clear rule on this subject would be desirable as it would enhance the protection of the civilian population against attack. In this respect, the same balanced approach as described above with respect to international armed conflicts seems justified in non-international armed conflicts.\n\n\n\n\nRule 14 - Proportionality in Attack\nRule 14. Launching an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated, is prohibited.\n\nPractice\n\nVolume II, Chapter 4.\n\n\nSummary\n\nState practice establishes this rule as a norm of customary international law applicable in both international and non-international armed conflicts.\n\n\nInternational armed conflicts\n\nThe principle of proportionality in attack is codified in Article 51(5)(b) of Additional Protocol I, and repeated in Article 57.1 At the Diplomatic Conference leading to the adoption of the Additional Protocols, France voted against Article 51 because it deemed that paragraph 5 by its “very complexity would seriously hamper the conduct of defensive military operations against an invader and prejudice the inherent right of legitimate defence”.2 Upon ratification of Additional Protocol I, however, France did not enter a reservation to this provision. At the Diplomatic Conference leading to the adoption of the Additional Protocols, Mexico stated that Article 51 was so essential that it “cannot be the subject of any reservations whatsoever since these would be inconsistent with the aim and purpose of Protocol I and undermine its basis”.3 Also at the Diplomatic Conference, several States expressed the view that the principle of proportionality contained a danger for the protection of the civilian population but did not indicate an alternative solution to deal with the issue of incidental damage from attacks on lawful targets.4 The United Kingdom stated that Article 51(5)(b) was “a useful codification of a concept that was rapidly becoming accepted by all States as an important principle of international law relating to armed conflict”.5\nThe principle of proportionality in attack is also contained in Protocol II and Amended Protocol II to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.6 In addition, under the Statute of the International Criminal Court, “intentionally launching an attack in the knowledge that such attack will cause incidental loss of life or injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects … which would be clearly excessive in relation to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated” constitutes a war crime in international armed conflicts.7\nA large number of military manuals lay down the principle of proportionality in attack.8 Sweden’s IHL Manual, in particular, identifies the principle of proportionality as set out in Article 51(5) of Additional Protocol I as a rule of customary international law.9 Numerous States have adopted legislation making it an offence to carry out an attack which violates the principle of proportionality.10This rule is supported by official statements.11 This practice includes that of States not, or not at the time, party to Additional Protocol I.12 When the ICRC appealed to the parties to the conflict in the Middle East in October 1973, i.e., before the adoption of Additional Protocol I, to respect the principle of proportionality in attack, the States concerned (Egypt, Iraq, Israel and Syrian Arab Republic) replied favourably.13\nIn their submissions to the International Court of Justice in the Nuclear Weapons case and Nuclear Weapons (WHO) case, numerous States, including States not, or not at the time, party to Additional Protocol I, invoked the principle of proportionality in their assessments of whether an attack with nuclear weapons would violate international humanitarian law.14 In its advisory opinion, the Court acknowledged the applicability of the principle of proportionality, stating that “respect for the environment is one of the elements that go to assessing whether an action is in conformity with the principles of necessity and proportionality”.15\n\n\nNon-international armed conflicts\n\nWhile Additional Protocol II does not contain an explicit reference to the principle of proportionality in attack, it has been argued that it is inherent in the principle of humanity which was explicitly made applicable to the Protocol in its preamble and that, as a result, the principle of proportionality cannot be ignored in the application of the Protocol.16 The principle has been included in more recent treaty law applicable in non-international armed conflicts, namely Amended Protocol II to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.17 In addition, it is included in other instruments pertaining also to non-international armed conflicts.18\nMilitary manuals which are applicable in or have been applied in non-international armed conflicts specify the principle of proportionality in attack.19 Many States have adopted legislation making it an offence to violate the principle of proportionality in attack in any armed conflict.20 In the Military Junta case in 1985, the National Appeals Court of Argentina considered the principle of proportionality in attack to be part of customary international law.21 There are also a number of official statements pertaining to armed conflicts in general or to non-international armed conflicts in particular that refer to this rule.22 The pleadings of States before the International Court of Justice in the Nuclear Weapons case referred to above were couched in general terms applicable in all armed conflicts.\nThe jurisprudence of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and a report of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights provide further evidence of the customary nature of this rule in non-international armed conflicts.23\nNo official contrary practice was found with respect to either international or non-international armed conflicts. Alleged violations of the principle of proportionality in attack have generally been condemned by States.24 The United Nations and other international organizations have also condemned such violations, for example, in the context of the conflicts in Chechnya, Kosovo, the Middle East and the former Yugoslavia.25\nThe ICRC has reminded parties to both international and non-international armed conflicts of their duty to respect the principle of proportionality in attack.26\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nSeveral States have stated that the expression “military advantage” refers to the advantage anticipated from the military attack considered as a whole and not only from isolated or particular parts of that attack.27 The relevant provision in the Statute of the International Criminal Court refers to the civilian injuries, loss of life or damage being excessive “in relation to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated” (emphasis added).28 The ICRC stated at the Rome Conference on the Statute of the International Criminal Court that the addition of the word “overall” to the definition of the crime could not be interpreted as changing existing law.29 Australia, Canada and New Zealand have stated that the term “military advantage” includes the security of the attacking forces.30\nUpon ratification of Additional Protocol I, Australia and New Zealand stated that they interpreted the term “concrete and direct military advantage anticipated” as meaning that there is a bona fide expectation that the attack would make a relevant and proportional contribution to the objective of the military attack involved.31According to the Commentary on the Additional Protocols, the expression “concrete and direct” military advantage was used in order to indicate that the advantage must be “substantial and relatively close, and that advantages which are hardly perceptible and those which would only appear in the long term should be disregarded”.32\nNumerous States have pointed out that those responsible for planning, deciding upon or executing attacks necessarily have to reach their decisions on the basis of their assessment of the information from all sources which is available to them at the relevant time.33 These statements were generally made with reference to Articles 51–58 of Additional Protocol I, without excluding their application to the customary rule.\n\n\n\n\nRule 22 - Principle of Precautions against the Effects of Attacks\nRule 22. The parties to the conflict must take all feasible precautions to protect the civilian population and civilian objects under their control against the effects of attacks.\n\nPractice\n\nVolume II, Chapter 6, Section A.\n\n\nSummary\n\nState practice establishes this rule as a norm of customary international law applicable in both international and non-international armed conflicts. This is a basic rule to which more content is given by the specific obligations contained in Rules 23–24. The practice collected in terms of those specific obligations is also relevant to prove the existence of this rule and vice versa.\n\n\nInternational armed conflicts\n\nThe duty of each party to the conflict to take all feasible precautions to protect the civilian population and civilian objects under its control against the effects of attacks is set forth in Article 58(c) of Additional Protocol I, to which no reservations have been made.\nNumerous military manuals restate the duty of parties to the conflict to take all feasible precautions to protect the civilian population and civilian objects under their control against the effects of attacks. This obligation is supported by official statements and reported practice. This practice includes that of States not, or not at the time, party to Additional Protocol I.\n\n\nNon-international armed conflicts\n\nThe obligation to take all feasible precautions to protect the civilian population and civilian objects against the effects of attacks was included in the draft of Additional Protocol II but was dropped at the last moment as part of a package aimed at the adoption of a simplified text. As a result, Additional Protocol II does not explicitly require precautions against the effects of attack. Article 13(1) requires that “the civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against the dangers arising from military operations”. It would be difficult to comply with this requirement without taking precautions against the effects of attack. The requirement to take precautions against the effects of attacks has, moreover, been included in more recent treaty law applicable in non-international armed conflicts, namely the Second Protocol to the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property. In addition, this rule is contained in other instruments pertaining also to non-international armed conflicts.\nMilitary manuals which are applicable in or have been applied in non-international armed conflicts specify the requirement to take precautions against the effects of attacks. It is supported by reported practice.\nIn 1965, the 20th International Conference of the Red Cross adopted a resolution calling on governments and other authorities responsible for action in all armed conflicts to spare the civilian population as much as possible. This was reaffirmed by the UN General Assembly in a resolution on respect for human rights in armed conflict adopted in 1968. In addition, in a resolution adopted in 1970 on basic principles for the protection of civilian populations in armed conflicts, the UN General Assembly required that “in the conduct of military operations, every effort should be made to spare civilian populations from the ravages of war, and all necessary precautions should be taken to avoid injury, loss or damage to civilian populations”.\nThe jurisprudence of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in the Kupreškić case provides further evidence of the customary nature of the requirement to take precautions against the effects of attacks in both international and non-international armed conflicts. In its judgment, the Tribunal considered that this rule was customary because it specified and fleshed out general pre-existing norms. It can be argued indeed that the principle of distinction (see Rules 1 and 7), which is customary in international and non-international armed conflicts, inherently requires respect for this rule. The Tribunal also relied on the fact that this rule had not been contested by any State. This study found no official contrary practice either.\nThis practice should be read together with the extensive practice on the prohibition of the use of human shields (see Rule 97). The deliberate violation of the obligation to take all feasible precautions against the effects of attacks is often related to the use of human shields. In addition, international case-law has confirmed the obligation under international human rights law to take positive steps to protect life (see commentary to Rule 97).\n\n\nExamples of precautions against the effects of attacks\n\nSpecific examples of how the general obligation to take precautions against the effects of attacks has been implemented include first and foremost the two specific obligations identified in Rules 23 and 24 below.\nIn addition, practice has shown that the construction of shelters, digging of trenches, distribution of information and warnings, withdrawal of the civilian population to safe places, direction of traffic, guarding of civilian property and the mobilization of civil defence organizations are measures that can be taken to spare the civilian population and civilian objects under the control of a party to the conflict.\n\n\nFeasibility of precautions against the effects of attack\n\nThe obligation to take precautions against the effects of attacks “to the extent feasible” has been interpreted by many States as meaning that the obligation is limited to those precautions which are practicable or practically possible, taking into account all circumstances ruling at the time, including humanitarian and military considerations. The Rapporteur of the Working Group at the Diplomatic Conference leading to the adoption of the Additional Protocols reported that after the phrase “to the maximum extent feasible” had been introduced to qualify all subparagraphs of Article 58, agreement was quickly reached. According to the Rapporteur, this revision reflected the concern of small and densely populated countries which would find it difficult to separate civilians and civilian objects from military objectives and that even large countries would find such separation difficult or impossible to arrange in many cases. Upon ratification of Additional Protocol I, Austria and Switzerland stated that the obligation would be applied subject to the requirements of the defence of the national territory.\nState practice indicates that an attacker is not prevented from attacking military objectives if the defender fails to take appropriate precautions or deliberately uses civilians to shield military operations. The attacker remains bound in all circumstances, however, to take appropriate precautions in attack (see Rule 15) and must respect the principle of proportionality (see Rule 14) even though the defender violates international humanitarian law.\n\n\nInformation required for deciding upon precautions against the effects of attack\n\nNumerous States have indicated that military commanders have to reach decisions concerning the taking of precautions against the effects of attack on the basis of their assessment of the information from all sources which is available to them at the relevant time.\n\n\n\n\nRule 23. Location of Military Objectives outside Densely Populated Areas\nRule 23. Each party to the conflict must, to the extent feasible, avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas.\n\nPractice\n\nVolume II, Chapter 6, Section B.\n\n\nSummary\n\nState practice establishes this rule as a norm of customary international law applicable in international, and arguably also in non-international, armed conflicts. This rule is an application of the principle of distinction (see Rules 1 and 7). It is also related to the prohibition of human shields (see Rule 97), as everything feasible must be done to separate military objectives from the civilian population, but in no event may civilians be used to shield military objectives.\n\n\nInternational armed conflicts\n\nThe duty of each party to the conflict to avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas is set forth in Article 58(b) of Additional Protocol I, to which no reservations relevant to this rule have been made. It is also contained in the Israel-Lebanon Ceasefire Understanding of 1996.\nA large number of military manuals include this obligation. It is also supported by official statements and reported practice. This practice includes that of States not, or not at the time, party to Additional Protocol I.\n\n\nNon-international armed conflicts\n\nAlthough Additional Protocol II does not explicitly require precautions against the effects of attacks, Article 13(1) stipulates that “the civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against the dangers arising from military operations” and it would be difficult to afford such protection when military objectives are located within or near densely populated areas. The requirement to take this precaution against the effects of attacks has, moreover, been included in more recent treaty law applicable in non-international armed conflicts, namely the Second Protocol to the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property. In addition, this rule is contained in other instruments pertaining also to non-international armed conflicts.\nMilitary manuals which are applicable in or have been applied in non-international armed conflicts specify the duty of each party to the conflict to avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas.\nThe jurisprudence of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in the Kupreškić case provides further evidence of the customary nature of the duty of each party to the conflict to avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas in both international and non-international armed conflicts. In its judgment, the Tribunal considered that this rule was customary because it specified and fleshed out general pre-existing norms. It can be argued indeed that the principle of distinction (see Rules 1 and 7) and the principle of proportionality (see Rule 14), which are both customary in international and non-international armed conflicts, inherently require respect for this rule. The Tribunal also relied on the fact that this rule had not been contested by any State. This study found no official contrary practice either.\nIn 1979, in the context of the conflict in Rhodesia/Zimbabwe, the ICRC appealed to the Patriotic Front to “clearly separate civilian establishments, particularly refugee camps, from military installations”.\nThe rules which require that persons deprived of their liberty be held in premises which are removed from the combat zone (see Rule 121) and that in case of displacement all possible measures be taken in order that the civilian population may be received under satisfactory conditions of safety (see Rule 131), which are both applicable in international and non-international armed conflicts, are also relevant in establishing the customary nature of this rule.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nWhile some practice refers to the duty to locate military bases and installations outside densely populated areas, practice in general limits this obligation to what is feasible. It is possible, as several reports on State practice point out, that demographic changes cause military bases to be located within or near cities where this was originally not the case. When such objectives involve immovable property, it is less feasible to move them than in the case of movable property. At the Diplomatic Conference leading to the adoption of the Additional Protocols, South Korea stated that this rule “does not constitute a restriction on a State’s military installations on its own territory”. Dual use installations, such as railway stations and airports, may even be located near or inside densely populated areas on purpose.\n\n\n\n\nRule 80 - Booby-Traps\nRule 80. The use of booby-traps which are in any way attached to or associated with objects or persons entitled to special protection under international humanitarian law or with objects that are likely to attract civilians is prohibited.\n\nPractice\n\nVolume II, Chapter 28.\n\n\nSummary\n\nState practice establishes this rule as a norm of customary international law applicable in both international and non-international armed conflicts.\n\n\nInternational armed conflicts\n\nBoth treaty practice and other State practice support the premise that booby-traps are prohibited if, by their nature or employment, their use violates the legal protection accorded to a protected person or object by another customary rule of international humanitarian law. This is the reasoning behind the list of booby-traps prohibited in Protocol II and Amended Protocol II to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.\nThe list of booby-traps prohibited by Protocol II and Amended Protocol II to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons is found in the military manuals and legislation of some States party to these treaties. Other military manuals are more general in their description and stress that booby-traps associated with objects in normal civilian daily use are prohibited, and that booby-traps must not be used in association with protected persons, protected objects (such as medical supplies, gravesites and cultural or religious property) or internationally recognized protective emblems or signs (such as the red cross and red crescent). Several manuals further specify that booby-traps must not be used in connection with certain objects likely to attract civilians, such as children’s toys. These prohibitions are also to be found in the military manuals and statements of States not, or not at the time, party to Protocol II or Amended Protocol II to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.\n\n\nNon-international armed conflicts\n\nThe premise behind the prohibitions of the use of certain kinds of booby-traps or the use of booby-traps in certain situations during international armed conflicts is equally valid for non-international armed conflicts. Furthermore, during the discussions on the extension of the applicability of Amended Protocol II to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons to non-international armed conflicts, the application of the Protocol’s provisions on booby-traps to such conflicts was uncontested. Although the discussions took place in the context of treaty negotiations, they indicate that States considered it pertinent that civilians and objects protected by the rules of international humanitarian law applicable in non-international armed conflicts should equally be protected against booby-traps that would have the effect of violating those rules.\nIn addition, the regulation of booby-traps is also contained in military manuals and national legislation applicable in non-international armed conflicts. Colombia’s Constitutional Court has held that the prohibition of certain booby-traps in non-international armed conflicts is part of customary international law.\n\n\nUse of other booby-traps\n\nBooby-traps which are used in a way not prohibited by the current rule are still subject to the general rules on the conduct of hostilities, in particular the principle of distinction (see Rules 1 and 7) and the principle of proportionality (see Rule 14). In addition, the rule that all feasible precautions must be taken to avoid, and in any event to minimize, incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian objects (see Rule 15) must also be respected.\n\n\n\n\nRule 81 - Restrictions on the Use of Landmines\nRule 81. When landmines are used, particular care must be taken to minimize their indiscriminate effects.\n\nPractice\n\nVolume II, Chapter 29, Section B.\n\n\nSummary\n\nState practice establishes this rule as a norm of customary international law applicable in both international and non-international armed conflicts. This rule applies to the use of anti-vehicle mines. It also applies in relation to anti-personnel landmines for States which have not yet adopted a total ban on their use.\n\n\nInternational armed conflicts\n\nMany of the rules in both the original and amended versions of Protocol II to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, as well as other State practice, are aimed at obviating the indiscriminate effects of mines. The provisions of these treaties, which include the prohibitions of certain types of mines as well as further limitations, are specifically aimed at limiting the potentially indiscriminate damage caused by these weapons. Furthermore, practice shows that the customary rules applying to the conduct of hostilities, such as the principle of distinction (see Rules 1 and 7), the principle of proportionality (see Rule 14) and the obligation to take all feasible precautions in attack (see Rule 15), are equally applicable to the use of landmines.\nThe obligation to take particular care when using landmines is based on a number of rules that have been codified in Protocol II to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. This Protocol sets out general rules on the emplacement of all landmines. It also outlines specific restrictions on the use of remotely delivered landmines and non-remotely delivered landmines used in populated areas. In addition, the Protocol requires that all feasible precautions be taken to protect civilians from the effects of these weapons. The Protocol also refers to special precautionary measures such as marking and signposting of minefields, recording minefields, monitoring minefields and procedures to protect UN forces and missions. Protocol II to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons was adopted by consensus and was not controversial at the time.\nMany military manuals set forth special precautionary measures to be taken when using landmines. There are also indications that the provisions of Protocol II to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons are considered to constitute an authoritative minimum standard in relation to the use of landmines which are not specifically prohibited under treaty obligations, as are anti-personnel landmines under the Ottawa Convention on Anti-Personnel Mines. As a result, these precautionary measures as a whole provide an indication of the types of measures States believe must be taken to minimize the indiscriminate effects of landmines.\nAmended Protocol II to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons reaffirms and develops the precautionary measures to be taken when using landmines.\n\n\nNon-international armed conflicts\n\nThe original Protocol II to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons was only applicable in international armed conflicts, and physical practice in internal conflicts has for the most part not been consistent with these rules. However, the concern shown by the UN Security Council, UN General Assembly and individual States about the effects of landmines on civilians in non-international armed conflicts is an indication of the international community’s view that civilians must be protected from mines in such situations. The extension of the scope of application of Amended Protocol II to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons to non-international armed conflicts reflects this view. Since then, the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons itself has been amended so that the original Protocol II is also applicable in non-international armed conflicts for States adhering to the amended Convention. The amendment, adopted at the Second Review Conference in 2001, was not controversial. Hence, there is a strong case for the existence of a customary rule in non-international armed conflicts that mines must not be used in ways that amount to indiscriminate attacks and that particular care must therefore be taken to minimize their indiscriminate effects.\n\n\nAnti-personnel landmines\n\nWith over 140 ratifications of the Ottawa Convention on Anti-Personnel Mines, and others on the way, the majority of States are treaty-bound no longer to use, produce, stockpile and transfer anti-personnel landmines. However, several States, including China, Finland, India, Republic of Korea, Pakistan, Russian Federation and the United States, have not ratified the Ottawa Convention on Anti-Personnel Mines and maintain that they are still entitled to use anti-personnel landmines. About a dozen non-party States have used anti-personnel mines in recent conflicts. This practice means that it cannot be said at this stage that the use of anti-personnel landmines is prohibited under customary international law.\nHowever, almost all States, including those that are not party to the Ottawa Convention on Anti-Personnel Mines and are not in favour of their immediate ban, have agreed that they need to work towards the eventual elimination of anti-personnel landmines. Particularly noteworthy is the Final Declaration adopted by consensus by States party to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons at the Second Review Conference in 2001, including by a number of States not party to the Ottawa Convention on Anti-Personnel Mines. In the Declaration, the States parties “solemnly declare … their conviction that all States should strive towards the goal of the eventual elimination of anti-personnel landmines globally”. In addition, a number of UN General Assembly resolutions have urged States to contribute to the elimination of anti-personnel landmines. Although there were some abstentions to these resolutions, the majority of abstaining States have since joined the Declaration adopted at the Second Review Conference or have made statements recognizing the goal of the eventual elimination of anti-personnel mines, in particular Ethiopia in 1995 and Turkey in 2002 (which has now also ratified the Ottawa Convention on Anti-Personnel Mines). Resolutions adopted by the OIC Conference of Ministers of Foreign Affairs in 1995 and 1996 and by the 26th International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent in 1995 also support the eventual elimination of anti-personnel landmines. It is particularly noteworthy that, at their First Meeting in Maputo in 1999, States party to the Ottawa Convention on Anti-Personnel Mines adopted a Declaration calling upon States still using or possessing anti-personnel landmines to “cease now” from so doing. Such a statement to non-party States is a significant indication of the belief that all States should work towards the elimination of anti-personnel mines. All the practice cited above appears to indicate that an obligation to eliminate anti-personnel landmines is emerging.\n\n\n\n\nRule 97 - Human Shields\nRule 97. The use of human shields is prohibited.\n\nPractice\n\nVolume II, Chapter 32, Section J.\n\n\nSummary\n\nState practice establishes this rule as a norm of customary international law applicable in both international and non-international armed conflicts.\n\n\nInternational and non-international armed conflicts\n\nIn the context of international armed conflicts, this rule is set forth in the Third Geneva Convention (with respect to prisoners of war), the Fourth Geneva Convention (with respect to protected civilians) and Additional Protocol I (with respect to civilians in general). Under the Statute of the International Criminal Court, “utilizing the presence of a civilian or other protected person to render certain points, areas or military forces immune from military operations” constitutes a war crime in international armed conflicts\nThe prohibition of using human shields is contained in numerous military manuals, many of which extend the prohibition to all civilians. Using human shields constitutes a criminal offence under the legislation of many States. This practice includes that of States not, or not at the time, party to Additional Protocol I or to the Statute of the International Criminal Court. In 1990 and 1991, there was extensive condemnation by States of the use of prisoners of war and civilians by Iraq as human shields, and the United States declared that such use amounted to a war crime. The use of prisoners of war as human shields during the Second World War was the subject of war crimes trials by the UK Military Court at Lüneberg in the Student case in 1946 and by the US Military Tribunal at Nuremberg in the Von Leeb (The High Command Trial) case in 1948. In the Karadžić and Mladić case in 1995 before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the accused were charged with war crimes for using UN peacekeepers as human shields. In its review of the indictments the Tribunal upheld this charge.\nWith respect to non-international armed conflicts, Additional Protocol II does not explicitly mention the use of human shields, but such practice would be prohibited by the requirement that “the civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against the dangers arising from military operations”. It is significant, furthermore, that the use of human shields has often been equated with the taking of hostages, which is prohibited by Additional Protocol II, and by customary international law (see Rule 96). In addition, deliberately using civilians to shield military operations is contrary to the principle of distinction and violates the obligation to take feasible precautions to separate civilians and military objectives (see Rules 23–24).\nSeveral military manuals which apply in non-international armed conflicts prohibit the use of human shields. The legislation of several States criminalizes the use of human shields in non-international armed conflicts. The use of human shields in non-international armed conflicts has been condemned by States and by the United Nations, for example, with respect to the conflicts in Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Tajikistan and the former Yugoslavia.\nNo official contrary practice was found.\nThe ICRC has reminded parties to both international and non-international armed conflicts of the prohibition of using human shields.\nInternational human rights law does not prohibit the use of human shields as such, but this practice would constitute, among other things, a violation of the non-derogable right not to be arbitrarily deprived of the right to life (see commentary to Rule 89). The UN Human Rights Committee and regional human rights bodies have indicated that this right involves not only the right not to be killed, but also the duty of States to take measures to protect life. In Demiray v. Turkey, in which the applicant submitted that her husband had been used as a human shield, the European Court of Human Rights stated that “Article 2 may … imply in certain well-defined circumstances a positive obligation on the authorities to take preventive operational measures to protect an individual for which they are responsible”.\n\n\nDefinition of human shields\n\nThe prohibition of using human shields in the Geneva Conventions, Additional Protocol I and the Statute of the International Criminal Court are couched in terms of using the presence (or movements) of civilians or other protected persons to render certain points or areas (or military forces) immune from military operations. Most examples given in military manuals, or which have been the object of condemnations, have been cases where persons were actually taken to military objectives in order to shield those objectives from attacks. The military manuals of New Zealand and the United Kingdom give as examples the placing of persons in or next to ammunition trains. There were many condemnations of the threat by Iraq to round up and place prisoners of war and civilians in strategic sites and around military defence points. Other condemnations on the basis of this prohibition related to rounding up civilians and putting them in front of military units in the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and Liberia.\nIn the Review of the Indictments in the Karadžić and Mladić case, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia qualified physically securing or otherwise holding peacekeeping forces against their will at potential NATO air targets, including ammunition bunkers, a radar site and a communications centre, as using “human shields”.\nIt can be concluded that the use of human shields requires an intentional co-location of military objectives and civilians or persons hors de combat with the specific intent of trying to prevent the targeting of those military objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral notes\nAddressing the legality of a blockade\n\nThree Sources of International Law\n\nTreaties\n\nAgreements ratified between two or more countries.\n\n\nCustomary Law\n\nA group of people across time engage in a practice that is not codified into law, essentially common law?\nThey do this because they have a subjective belief that this is compulsory\n\n\nGeneral Principles\n\nThe permanent court of international justice in the league of nations was the first international court\n\n\nCase laws by international courts and writing by international publicists\n\n\nBig International Courts\n\nlol there’s a lot\n\n\nWho even has jurisdiction?\n\nConsiderations\n\nApplicable Law\n\nWhat pieces of international law are applicable to this situation?\n\n\nJurisdiction\n\nWhat courts can decide whether a law has been broken or not?\n\n\n\n\nICJ or the ICC\n\nICC litigates between individuals and the ICJ litigates between countries\n\n\nThe ICC -

Schmitt\n\nNotes\n\nThe resort to force is prohibited by Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and customary international law. It is a prohibition limited to interstate uses of force unless the forcible actions are legally attributable to a State (as described in the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility). In that Hamas is neither a State nor are its attacks likely attributable to a State, it has not violated this prohibition. Neither has Israel, for it is directing its operations against a non-State group.\nYet, even if Hamas’s action were attributable to a State (Iran or Palestine, for those who consider the latter a State), Israel’s response would nevertheless be lawful by reference to the customary international law right of self-defense enshrined in UN Charter Article 51. Many States (including the United States) and scholars (see Gill) are of the view that at least since the attacks of 9/11, self-defense is permissible against a non-State group even if the group’s “armed attack” was not “on behalf of a State … or [with] its substantial involvement therein” (the International Court of Justice’s Paramilitary Activities standard, para. 195).\nThis begs the question whether Hamas’s actions are justified as self-defense, as some supporters claim. They are not. To begin with, it is well accepted that the right of self-defense is limited to States. Even if that were not the case, self-defense is subject to a condition of necessity (Nuclear Weapons Advisory Opinion, para. 41; Armed Activities Judgment, para. 147). Necessity has a temporal component that limits forcible defensive actions to those responding to an armed attack that is either underway or imminent.\nHowever, this nuanced provision only acknowledges the right of certain peoples to resist and struggle, not necessarily to do so forcibly. The better view is that there is no “right” on the part of a non-State group or individuals to do so except when unlawful violence is being used against them directly and immediately, as in a specific case of acts of ethnic cleansing that are underway. At the time of Hamas’s attack, Israel was not employing unlawful violence directly against any individual in Gaza. Nor were Hamas’ actions crafted to directly defend against any particular unlawful acts of violence.\nWhile I accept Professor Dinstein’s general premise that the degree of control necessary to establish a state of occupation is not necessarily the exact degree required to maintain it, I find the contention that Israel has not been in occupation of Gaza since it withdrew to be more convincing. To begin with, effective control suggests some degree of power over the daily governance of the area in question. In Gaza, however, Hamas often governs in a manner that is contrary to Israel’s interests and desires. Moreover, when an area is used regularly as a base of significant military operations against a party to the conflict, the latter cannot be said to control the territory effectively.\nTherefore, only if Israel enters the territory and stays for a period not necessitated by immediate combat operations should it be considered as occupying Gaza. Simply put, a State is not in effective control if it must fight its way into the territory concerned at high cost. But if it does stay and exert its authority, Israel will be seen as occupying the area. Although this begs the question of whether occupation can even exist in a non-international armed conflict in the first place, Israeli courts applied occupation law to Gaza before the withdrawal of its forces despite early attempts by the government to avoid its de jure applicability (see Kretzmer, p. 210; Dinstein, p. 27). They, and much of the international community, would likely do so again.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nI believe that Hamas had no international law right to launch Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, while Israel was entirely within its rights to mount Operation Swords of Iron. The hostilities that have resulted are best classified as a non-international armed conflict. At the time of the attack, Israel was not occupying Gaza but may qualify as an occupying power if it moves into that area and controls it effectively. Each of these conclusions, however, is subject to reasonable disagreement or qualification. Sadly, much of the commentary on the conflict, especially on social media, has been far from reasonable and often inflammatory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2023.10.11 - The Siege of Gaza and the Starvation War Crime - by Tom Dannenbaum\n\nNotes\n\n1\n\n\nConclusions\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2023.10.11 - ISRAEL – HAMAS 2023 SYMPOSIUM – HOSTAGE-TAKING AND THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT - by John C. Tramazzo, Kevin S. Coble, Michael N. Schmitt\n\nNotes\n\n“Hostage-taking during armed conflict is universally condemned. For instance, on Monday, the UN Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory observed, “[t]he taking of hostages is a violation of international law and constitutes an international crime. Persons deprived of liberty are protected against murder, torture, and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and sexual violence.” Similarly, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights “call[ed] on Palestinian armed groups to immediately and unconditionally release all civilians who were captured and are still being held.” He emphasized that “[t]he taking of hostages is prohibited by international law.””\n“As a party to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, Israel is bound by Common Article 3. But so too is Hamas, for, as Jelena Pejic has noted in her excellent piece on Common Article 3, “The very language used also makes clear that it binds the non-state party, as it lists obligations incumbent on ‘each party to the conflict’” (p. 9).”\nBut in this case, Hamas has threatened to execute a hostage for every Israeli airstrike. Recalling the definition above, this is a “threat to kill … [a] person in order to compel a third party to … abstain from doing any act as an explicit … condition for the … well-being of the hostages.” Additionally, an implicit reason for bringing the hostages into Gaza was almost certainly to frustrate Israeli operations there. And given Hamas’s past practices, it is highly probable that the civilians and even the IDF personnel were captured in preparation for future prisoner exchanges (see, e.g., the Gilad Shalit incident).\n“According to the ICRC, the prohibition on hostage-taking is now “firmly entrenched in customary international law and is considered a war crime.” We agree. In this regard, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which codifies key customary war crimes, provides that hostage-taking is a war crime in international and non-international armed conflict (art. 8(2)(a)(viii) and art. 8(2)(c)(iii), respectively).”\n“International criminal tribunals have conducted numerous cases in which defendants were charged with taking hostages. Prominent examples include the ICTY’s Karadžić and Mladić case involving the seizure of nearly 300 UN peacekeepers to shield against NATO air attack, and the 2000 Blaškić and 2001 Kordić and Čerkez cases that resulted in convictions for the taking of civilian hostages.”\n\n\nConclusions\n\n“Shockingly, hostage-taking was a central feature of Hamas’ opening salvo in its conflict in Israel. Israel and many other nations, including the United States, are now struggling to address this horrific situation. Unfortunately, hostage rescue operations present some of the most challenging tactical scenarios for armed forces, especially in an environment like Gaza. But Hamas has violated the law of armed conflict without the slightest doubt. It is equally clear that those involved are subject to worldwide prosecution as war criminals under international criminal law.”\n\n\n\n\n2023.10.27 - ISRAEL – HAMAS 2023 SYMPOSIUM – THE IDF, HAMAS, AND THE DUTY TO WARN - by Michael N. Schmitt\n\nNotes\n\n“Seven decades later, the requirement was included in Additional Protocol I to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which binds the instrument’s 174 parties (which do not include Israel or the United States) during international armed conflict. Its Article 57 requires an attacking State to take various “precautions in attack” (“active precautions”) to avoid harming civilians and civilian objects. Among them is the requirement to give “effective advance warning … of attacks which may affect the civilian population, unless circumstances do not permit.” Other precautions cited in the article include verifying the target, applying the rule of proportionality during the attack, and selecting tactics, weapons, and targets to minimize harm to civilians and civilian objects. Although often characterized as an aspect of proportionality (see U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Law of War Manual, § 5.11), I see active precautions as a stand-alone requirement deriving from the principle of distinction, for it applies even when an attack would otherwise satisfy the proportionality rule.”\n“The IDF understands these realities and has accordingly long provided warnings before attacking targets in Gaza and elsewhere (see, e.g., report on 2008 Gaza operation, paras. 262-265; Sharvit, Baruch, &amp; Neuman, p. 367-72)). These practices have drawn a great deal of attention. For instance, an International Law Association (ILA) Study Group on the Conduct of Hostilities (of which I was a member) observed in 2017 that, “Israel’s 2014 operations in Gaza, and the extensive efforts to provide such warnings, have elevated the discourse on this warnings precaution to unprecedented levels: some worry that the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) created an unrealistically high bar on when and how to provide warnings; conversely, some condemn the IDF because the warnings did not produce their intended effects; finally, some suggest that the extent of warnings were the result of policy decisions, and not legal obligation.&quot;&quot;\n“To conduct the phone warnings, the IDF employs a specialized team of trained personnel who run a “phone bank” with the sole purpose of contacting individuals who might be affected by a strike. The calls are in some cases extremely precise. For instance, the warning may be that a strike will occur at a specified time. Live operators make some phone warnings, while others consist of generic pre-recorded messages. The personnel in the warning cell speak Arabic fluently, have received cultural training on the civilian population in the target area, and whenever feasible, use all-source fused intelligence to focus on specific individuals who might be at risk. For example, understanding Palestinian culture and family structures, the warning cell may try to contact the male head of a family in a particular apartment building, knowing that he will effectively disseminate the warning to other family members. If a minor or a female answers the phone call, the warning cell attempts to speak to the head of the family. When several buildings in a particular area are targeted, the warning cell may also contact a local civilian official or an informal community leader who will be able to spread the warning effectively and insist on obedience.”\n“Beyond these communicative warnings, the IDF uses military actions designed to warn. In the ground environment, these include warning shots (perhaps with tracers to convey the risk better) and tactical “call-outs,” where ground forces yell to occupants in a building, warning them to leave before the IDF troops enter (also a common U.S. practice). A more controversial method is so-called “roof knocking.” As Colonel Merriam and I explained, “The technique involves employing … munitions that impact one corner of the roof and detonates a very small explosion that produces noise and concussion several minutes in advance of the strike. The civilians are hopefully frightened into dispersing. Once it has cleared the target area, the IDF launches the attack.””\n“Warnings must be “effective.” This does not require that they prove successful. Instead, the term effective denotes a warning that will reach the affected civilians and, in the circumstances, can reasonably be expected to have the desired effect of reducing the risk to them. To illustrate, a warning to leave a building that does not give the occupants sufficient time to do so is not an effective warning. But the IDF’s warning to residents of northern Gaza to move south is effective, despite being ignored by some, for it has been conveyed to the residents, and up to a million people reportedly have heeded it. Of course, southern Gaza remains dangerous, for the IDF is striking Hamas and other organized armed groups present there, as it may lawfully do. Yet, as it is less dangerous than the north, the warning is effective as a matter of law.”\n“Despite the presumption that an attacker must warn, it need not do so when not feasible. As the DoD Law of War Manual notes, “Circumstances not permitting the giving of advance warning include where giving a warning would be incompatible with legitimate military requirements” (§ 5.11.5.4). All the warning requirements described above are subject to this caveat, which reflects the balance between military necessity and humanitarian considerations that permeates IHL.”\n“Whether circumstances permit is a fact-dependent determination. Consider an attack on a building. If the military objective is the building itself, as in the case of one that houses civilians but also is used for military purposes (a common practice in Gaza), there may be an opportunity to warn the civilian occupants to evacuate without forfeiting the opportunity to achieve the desired military effect on the building. But if the intended target is someone in the building, providing advanced warning might allow them to escape. No warning may be required in such a case because surprise is essential.”\n“The safety of one’s own forces can also preclude warning. For example, dropping leaflets over Gaza may not have been possible if the organized armed groups operating there fielded effective air defenses. Similarly, once the IDF enters Gaza and is engaged in urban combat, warnings by the ground forces often will be impractical, if only because they might alert Hamas to their positions.”\n“A particular obstacle to warnings in Gaza is Hamas’s practice of human shielding. In the past, there have been many instances where civilians have moved voluntarily to the vicinity of targets following IDF warnings. Even more egregious is the use of involuntary human shields. With Hamas holding 200 hostages, the potential for their movement to locations regarding which the IDF issues a specific warning is high. When a warning is likely to result in human shielding, the situation amounts to one in which a warning is not feasible.”\n“Passive precautions include moving civilians from the vicinity of military objectives and avoiding placing military objectives within or near densely populated areas. Although Article 58 includes no reference to warnings, it does require a defender to “take the other necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations.” In my opinion, this requires it to warn of attacks when doing so is feasible. As the DoD Law of War Manual observes, “[v]oluntary removal of civilians may be accomplished through the use of warnings” (§ 5.14.2).”\n“As we are witnessing, civilian casualties in Gaza, even when they amount to lawful collateral damage, benefit Hamas by undercutting support for Israel. Thus, it is no surprise that Hamas has violated its passive precautions obligations by failing to evacuate any civilians from northern Gaza and operating from civilian buildings, including those that are specially protected, like medical facilities. Equally, its failure to warn civilians away from areas where attacks are sure to take place violates IHL, as does urging them to ignore Israeli warnings.”\n\n\nConclusions\n\n“Without more facts, it is too early to say whether the IDF has complied with the obligation to warn in every case. However, there is no question that the IDF’s warnings practice, in general, is the gold standard. Indeed, as a matter of policy, the IDF typically exceeds what the law requires. It is likewise clear that its warning to evacuate northern Gaza constitutes an “effective warning,” as that concept is understood in IHL.”\n“This is in sharp contrast to Hamas’s failure to provide any warnings to the civilian population of Gaza and its efforts to neutralize the effectiveness of the IDF’s. That Hamas has violated its own warning obligation under IHL is simply indisputable.”\n\n\n\n\n2023.11.03 - ISRAEL – HAMAS 2023 SYMPOSIUM – WHAT IS AND IS NOT HUMAN SHIELDING? - by Michael N. Schmitt\n\nNotes\n\n“Placing fighters or equipment next to, in, or under facilities where there are many civilians when there appears to be no military need to do so or reasonably available alternatives exist, as in the case of a hospital or a school, is a powerful indicator of intent. As the DoD Law of War Manual observes, “An adversary’s intention to violate this rule is likely to be clear because that adversary normally would make it apparent to the opposing party that attacks against the military objective being shielded would risk harming protected persons or objects””\n“Other cases are less clear. For instance, Hamas and other fighters are likely among those civilians fleeing Gaza City. If the fighters are on the evacuation routes solely to retreat from the area into which the IDF is striking, there is no human shielding even though civilians are using the same route. However, if they choose to retreat on that route because of the presence of civilians, they are using human shields. The difficulty would lie in determining their motivation.”\nAlthough a particular action by Hamas may not qualify as using human shields, the customary requirement to take passive precautions would still apply. As explained in Article 58 of Additional Protocol I, the defender must “avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas” and has to take “other necessary precautions to protect the civilian population, individual civilians and civilian objects under their control against the dangers resulting from military operations.” Thus, operating in the vicinity of civilians and civilian objects, and thereby placing them at significant risk of being harmed incidentally during attacks when doing so is clearly avoidable, violates the requirement. This is a customary law rule applicable in this conflict (see ICTY, Kupreškić, para. 524; ICRC, Customary IHL study, rule 22).\n“However, in my opinion, individuals who intentionally leverage their civilian status to impede the enemy’s operations are directly participating in hostilities and, therefore, lose these protections from attack for such time as they so participate. This is the position of the United States, Israel, and many prominent scholars (DoD Law of War Manual, § 5.12.3.4; here, p. 118-19; Dinstein, p. 209). The distinction between involuntary and voluntary shields makes sense, for the latter act to deprive themselves of their LOAC protections, whereas the former are being victimized. To the extent that voluntary shields can de facto (cause the attacker to hesitate) or de jure (render the attack disproportionate if they do not lose civilian protections) make an attack impossible, it would seem clear that they are “participating” in the hostilities very directly. However, although attacks on direct participants technically are permissible under the law of armed conflict, Israel does not conduct them. Instead, the direct participation status of voluntary shields only affects the application of the proportionality and precautions in attack rules during Israeli operations (see here, p. 118).”\n“In its 2014 Operation Protective Edge into Gaza, the IDF urged the civilian population to evacuate the area of operations and identified evacuation routes, just as it is doing today. Many did not heed the warning. I later had the opportunity to meet with senior IDF legal advisers and discuss the matter in depth. They uniformly rejected the premise that such individuals should be treated as voluntary shields (see here, p. 119).”\n\n\nConclusions\n\n“Whether this armed conflict is international or non-international in character, using human shields is strictly prohibited. However, the concept of human shielding in the law of armed conflict is narrower than sometimes characterized. In particular, it does not encompass merely acting in the proximity of civilians without intending to use their presence to affect enemy military operations. Nor does it extend to using civilian property to shield unless that property is subject to special protection, as with medical facilities and cultural property.”\n“Nevertheless, Hamas has violated the prohibition by, among other acts, using hostages as shields and preventing civilians from leaving northern Gaza. It has also violated obligations not to use specially protected facilities as shields. And even when its actions do not amount to unlawful shielding, they are subject to the requirement to take feasible passive precautions to safeguard the civilian population. But it must be emphasized that violations of these obligations by Hamas do not release Israel from its obligations to, inter alia, consider involuntary human shields in proportionality calculations and when assessing feasible precautions in attack.”\n\n\n\n\n2023.12.01 - Israel – Hamas 2023 Symposium – Israel’s Right to Self-Defence against Hamas - by Nicholas Tsagourias\n\nNotes\n\nFourth, self-defence is triggered by a factual occurrence, an armed attack. Whether an armed attack exists does not depend on the status of its author as a State, contrary to the ICJ’s opinion (see Wall Advisory Opinion, para. 139). This is evident from the wording of Article 51 which does not define the author of the armed attack but only the triggering event. Also, an armed attack is not conterminous with a violation of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. When the ICJ defined an armed attack as a grave use of force (P__aramilitary Activities, para. 191), it provided a description of the nature of an armed attack by using factual qualifications such a scale and effects. This means there is no restriction as to who can commit an armed attack; it can be a State or a non-State actor.\nAll this means that Israel has the right to act in self-defence against Hamas because the conditions for triggering the right to self-defence have been fulfilled. There was an armed attack and Hamas was the author of the October 7 armed attack. This is regardless of whether Article 2(4) is implicated or the status of Hamas as non-State actor.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nThe main take-aways from this post are that the right to self-defence is a primary rule of international law which is not dependent on Article 2(4) prohibiting the use of force. It is also a right which is triggered by a factual event, an armed attack, and is exercised against the author of the attack be that a State or a non-State actor. If a State takes self-defence action against non-State actors on the territory of a State which is not implicated in the attack, the incidental breach of that State’s sovereignty is excused by self-defence as a circumstance precluding wrongfulness according to the law of State responsibility provided that the action stays within the boundaries of self-defence. This shows that there is no gap in international law when faced with non-State attacks and the right to self-defence demonstrates its full potential.\n\n\n\n\n2023.12.28 - ‘Screams Without Words’: How Hamas Weaponized Sexual Violence on Oct. 7 - by Jeffrey Gettleman, Anat Schwartz and Adam Sella\n\nNotes\n\nBased largely on the video evidence — which was verified by The New York Times — Israeli police officials said they believed that Ms. Abdush was raped, and she has become a symbol of the horrors visited upon Israeli women and girls during the Oct. 7 attacks.\nA combination of chaos, enormous grief and Jewish religious duties meant that many bodies were buried as quickly as possible. Most were never examined, and in some cases, like at the rave scene, where more than 360 people were slaughtered in a few hours, the bodies were hauled away by the truckload.\nAccording to Jewish tradition, funerals are held promptly. The result was that many bodies with signs of sexual abuse were put to rest without medical examinations, meaning that potential evidence now lies buried in the ground. International forensic experts said that it would be possible to recover some evidence from the corpses, but that it would be difficult.\nMany volunteers working for ZAKA, the emergency response team, are religious Jews and operate under strict rules that command deep respect for the dead.\n“I did not take pictures because we are not allowed to take pictures,” said Yossi Landau, a ZAKA volunteer. “In retrospect, I regret it.”\nThere are at least three women and one man who were sexually assaulted and survived, according to Gil Horev, a spokesman for Israel’s Ministry of Welfare and Social Affairs. “None of them has been willing to come physically for treatment,” he said. Two therapists said they were working with a woman who was gang raped at the rave and was in no condition to talk to investigators or reporters.\n\n\nConclusions\n\nLots o’ sexual crimes, lots o’ witnesses, lots of different people observed to have been sexually mistreated.\n\n\n\n\n2024.01.14 - NEW YORK TIMES PUTS “DAILY” EPISODE ON ICE AMID INTERNAL FIRESTORM OVER HAMAS SEXUAL VIOLENCE ARTICLE - by Daniel Boguslaw and Ryan Grim\n\nNotes\n\nInternal critics worry that the article is another “Caliphate”-level journalistic debacle. “There seems to be no self-awareness at the top,” said one frustrated Times editorial staffer. “The story deserved more fact-checking and much more reporting. All basic standards applied to countless other stories.”\n\n\nConclusion\nPoorly sourced articles who’s sources don’t justify any of the underlying assumptions. Some false reporting due to author’s ideological unwillingness to verify the veracity of other reporters or statements that seem to agree with their preconceived notions about the events.\n\n\n2024.01.09 - U.N. to Study Reports of Sexual Violence in Israel During Oct. 7 Attack - by Jeffrey Gettleman, Anat Schwartz and Adam Sella\n2024.02.28 - “BETWEEN THE HAMMER AND THE ANVIL” The Story Behind the New York Times October 7 Exposé - by Jeremy Scahill, Ryan Grim, and Daniel Boguslaw\n\nConclusion\n\nVery poorly sourced, untrustworthy article.

Multiple reports and video footage indicate that the Hamas assault inside Israel involved shocking massacres, abductions, physical abuse, and sexual violence. These acts implicate multiple war crimes, including the prohibition on killing civilians or persons hors de combat (ICC Statute, articles 8(2)(c)(i), 8(2)(e)(i)), the taking of hostages (8(2)(c)(iii)), rape and other forms of sexual violence (8(2)(e)(vi)), torture (8(2)(c)(i)), and outrages upon personal dignity (8(2)(c)(ii)).\nWhat is more, given the attacks’ widespread nature and systematicity (only one of which is legally necessary), they almost certainly constitute crimes against humanity. Within that category, murder (7(1)(a)), extermination (mass murder) (7(1)(b)), imprisonment (7(1)(e)), torture (7(1)(f)), and sexual violence (7(1)(g)) are all implicated. These are not close calls; international criminal law was designed to outlaw such atrocities.\n\n\n\nmiscellaneous\nwww.cambridge.org/core/journals/yearbook-of-international-humanitarian-law/article/abs/application-of-ihl-in-the-goldstone-report-a-critical-commentary/F346B942ADA0671ABAD93EBCB51F0A96\nsci-hub.hkvisa.net/10.1017/s1389135909000130\nlieber.westpoint.edu/white-phosphorus-and-international-law/\nwww.weaponslaw.org/weapons/white-phosphorus-munitions\nwww.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/10/lebanon-evidence-of-israels-unlawful-use-of-white-phosphorus-in-southern-lebanon-as-cross-border-hostilities-escalate/#:~:text=The%20usage%20of%20white%20phosphorus,and%20smoke%20it%20causes%20spread.\nwww.jstor.org/stable/2537368\nIn short, if there was a general policy of expulsion, why, at war’s end, were 100,000-160,000 Arabs, most of them Muslims, left in Israel (which at the time had about 700,000-750,000 Jews)?\nwww.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/how-hamas-manipulates-gaza-fatality-numbers-examining-male-undercount-and-other\nwww.youtube.com/watch\nwww.youtube.com/watch\ndigital-commons.usnwc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi\nlieber.westpoint.edu/legal-context-operations-al-aqsa-flood-swords-of-iron/\nlieber.westpoint.edu/weaponizing-civilians-human-shields-ukraine/\nwww.justsecurity.org/89403/the-siege-of-gaza-and-the-starvation-war-crime/\npapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm\nstratcomcoe.org/pdfjs/?zoom=page-fit\nsci-hub.hkvisa.net/10.1017/s1389135909000130\n1922 Mandate for Palestine\ntile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gdc/gdcwdl/wd/l_/11/57/2/wdl_11572/wdl_11572.pdf\nen.wikisource.org/wiki/Palestine_Mandate_(1922)\nInside the Hamas ‘Terror Tunnels’ Israel has been bombing\nwww.youtube.com/watch\nUN Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict (Richard Goldstone)\nwww.youtube.com/watch\nKafr Qasim massacre\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kafr_Qasim_massacre\nOslo vs DC track for Oslo Accords 1993\n\nLaw against negotiating with PLO?\nArafat suspended DC talks due to expulsion of 400 fighters to Lebanon.\nynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/wcm_upload_files/2023/06/18/ryrrtanDh/00071706_82_32_F1_56.pdf\nClinton Parameters - transparency.aljazeera.net/files/48.PDF\nReservations for Parameters - ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver5/wcm_upload_files/2023/06/18/ryrrtanDh/00071706_82_32_F1_56.pdf\nworld101.cfr.org/understanding-international-system/conflict/israeli-palestinian-conflict-timeline Another Timeline\nIsraeli ICJ Opinion - www.icj-cij.org/node/203452\nBenny Morris Operation Hiram revision - www.jstor.org/stable/2537935\nOpinions on the Conflict\nPro-Zionist\n\nThis Time, the Loser Writes History\nIsraeli Settlements Are Not Illegal\n2004.01.09 - Survival of the fittest\n2020.10.05 - Exclusive interview - Part 1 | Prince Bandar bin Sultan on Israel, Palestine and Washington\n\n\nPro-Palestinian\n\nThe War of the Israeli Historians\nIDF bars settler suspect linked to killing of Palestinian from West Bank for 6 months\nSuspect in Burqa killing cites ‘collective punishment’ as legitimate means against enemy\nIsraeli settler, far-right activist: ‘Spitting on Christians is a Jewish custom’\n1999.12.24 - Israel and Syria: Correcting the Record\n\n\nNeutral\n\nIsrael claims it is no longer occupying the Gaza Strip.

Seeing no realistic way for him to make bail or escape prison without serving the rest of his life there, Epstein decides to commit suicide.\nEvidence in Favor\n\nSome say the autopsy supports suicide\nNo direct evidence of any foul play\nNo testimony or indirect evidence of external pressure for him to kill himself\nEpstein clearly had a good reason to want to kill himself\n\nDifficult Facts\n\nSome contest that the autopsy was indicative of homicide (three broken bones)\nNo prisoner had committed suicide for 25 years\nCamera malfunctions and lack of footage availability\nGuards falling asleep/not checking in appropriately\nTaken off suicide watch after only 6 days\nWas supposed to have cell mate, didn’t on the night he suicided\n\nConclusion\nEpstein killing himself makes a lot of sense and is supported broadly by the facts, without any dispositive evidence or compelling reason to believe why this couldn’t be the case. However, there are many confusing questions and strange coincidences that don’t have many satisfying answers.\nSomeone Murdered Epstein\nTheory\nEpstein was a high profile billionaire who assisted many other powerful people with the trafficking and exploitation of women and minors. One of these high profile people (or possibly even someone within the government itself) hired a hitman/assassin to kill Epstein in jail.\nEvidence in Favor\n\nSome say the autopsy supports homicide.\nEpstein’s lawyers who met with him days earlier to create his will said he seemed to be in good spirits.\n\nDifficult Facts\n\nAbsolutely no evidence of anyone entering or leaving the cell area that could kill him.\nAutopsy almost certainly doesn’t support homicide.\nZero evidence or testimony from anyone implicating anyone at all in any sort of scheme to murder him.\nLots of witnesses/video evidence from outside the jail that shows no one entering/leaving.\n\nConclusion\nThis is the weakest of the “Epstein didn’t kill himself” narratives. There is almost no supporting evidence, and there is plenty of reason to believe it didn’t happen.\nConspiracy to encourage and allow Epstein to die\nTheory\nEpstein was a high profile billionaire who assisted many other powerful people with the trafficking and exploitation of women and minors. One of these high profile people (or possibly even someone within the government itself) pressured/forced Epstein to kill himself, and made sure the conditions were right such that it wouldn’t appear to come from an external source.\nEvidence in Favor\n\nSome say the autopsy supports suicide\nNo direct evidence of any foul play\nCould explain why he was released from suicide watch early.\nMany (?) rich and powerful people obviously wanted Epstein dead before he could testify about their involvement.\nHelps to conveniently explain a lot of difficult to explain facts in an ordinary suicide story.\n\nDifficult Facts\n\nNo testimony or indirect evidence of external pressure for him to kill himself.\nWhy wouldn’t they make it more obvious it was suicide? Why disable the cameras?\nWhy not just have him post bail and kill himself/kill him outside of jail?\n\nConclusion\nThis seems highly implausible, why would video be cut and disabled if they wanted to prove a suicide? There are so many easier/better ways to do this, especially if huge sums of money were involved.\nQuestions\n\nHow common is it for cameras to malfunction/footage to be unusable?\n\nThat jail had TONS of maintenance issues with cameras, electricity, plumbing, etc…The entire DVR2 system that records ~50% of the cameras was malfunctioning for at least three weeks prior to Epstein’s.\n\n\nHow common is it that people fail to check in on inmates, especially after already attempting suicide?\n\nOther inmates in the SHU said that the guards never do routine checks.\n\n\nHow long does it normally take someone to be removed from suicide watch after attempting suicide?\n\n???\n\n\nHow consistent was Epstein’s death with suicide vs homicide?

This is why a friend or family member will recommend taking along someone more experienced with you when purchasing a used car, so the more experienced party can spot the deception and inform the potential buyer that the seller has attempted to emulate the function via aesthetic rather than adopt the functionality itself.\nThis is what I mean when I talk about “aesthetic vs function.”\nIn public discourse, there are many things people say because it gives them the aesthetic of being truth-seeking, critical thinkers. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the time, this is achieved through deception and wordplay, rather than the person adopting the actual functionality they claim to have.\nExamples\nThe “Non-Partisan”\nThere is a desire to present oneself in a way that makes them “above” simply copying the political positions of their peers, even if that’s what they ultimately are doing. Very rarely does the “non-partisan” individual have a way of independently generating unique, consistent and coherent thoughts, but rather they find a way to criticize unimportant things that appear to be part of their political in-group while still aligning 100% with every important, core belief. An example of this would be being highly critical of Donald Trump’s “undesirable” but ultimately inconsequential flaws, such as his promiscuity or fiscal habits as president, while being in lock-step with the most integral beliefs of MAGA conservatives, such as his dangerously divisive rhetoric, claims of mass voter fraud, or his attitude that the entire political and corporate world are a “swamp” capable of being drained only by him.\nThe “Rational” One\n“Rationality,” or pretending to be someone possessing a high level of “reason” or critical analysis, is a highly desirable aesthetic that rarely follows the function of someone being rational. It is a scarce thing that when a person claims to be “rational” or “truth-seeking” does the person actually exhibit any qualities fundamental to those people; rather they tend to align almost entirely with certain other groups of people and they simply wield this “rationality” against someone else that belongs to the “wrong” side. It is almost universally considered a red flag when anyone has anything related to “truth” or “rationality” in their title or channel name, as they almost always appear to pursue anything but.\nThe “Skeptic”\n“Skepticism” is never applied evenly to anything. People are almost never skeptical from a place of rational criticism, but rather because the skepticism is required to maintain their cognitive consonance. People claim to be “skeptical” of everything, and they insist that they “do their own research,” but that more often than not just consists of them repeating things they’ve heard from some counter-culture podcast, or some unsavory social media account.\nThe “Uncomfortable Truth” Teller\n“Uncomfortable truths” are, ironically enough, nearly always a great source of comfort. These comfort-bearing factoids exhibit the guise of discomfort in order to smuggle in some incredibly convenient thing that explains all of the issues or social ills a person or group might be facing. Great examples of this might be telling people the “uncomfortable truth” that some huge system is against them, e.g. the FDA or WHO or IMF. At first glance, it may seem disconcerting that these large organizations can’t be trusted, but the people who call them into question will generally only do it to explain some other phenomenon that they otherwise can’t explain, and they often still continue, in practice, to trust these organizations anyway. For instance, a person will say they are vaccine-skeptical, but they still have no problem buying and consuming other over-the-counter medications. Or they may be opposed to how emergency use authorization was given for the mRNA vaccines, but they had no issue with monoclonal antibodies since they were recommended by Joe Rogan, despite them having less clinical evidence to support them.\nAlmost none of these “uncomfortable truths” require you to change your mind or your actions in a way that you wouldn’t already want to, but instead serve to motivate you to continue moving down a path you already found highly desirable. An easy test for this is that when someone hears an “uncomfortable truth,” it’s less likely to produce an uncomfortable feeling of “oh, no…” inside of them, and more likely to produce a euphoric feeling of “oh, yeah, I knew it!!!!” instead.\nLimitations\nThe problems of adopting an aesthetic of a function without the function itself should be obvious, in most cases. They have manifested throughout history as obvious scams, be it multi-level marketing schemes, snake oil salesmen, used car salesmen or other types of scammers. The damage from people who wear truth or rationality as an aesthetic do damage on two different fronts: they lure the listener into a false sense of security, fooling them into believing they are standing on epistemically firm ground when the truth is anything but, and they occupy space and crowd out other, more reasonable voices, who now have to spend time convincing others that they are the “real” rational people, and not the aesthetically rational people plaguing the same space.\nHow to Avoid\nThere are many simple strategies you can deploy to avoid falling into this trap, but I’d recommend checking out my tips for checking cognitive biases to start.\nWhat you should essentially be doing is finding some good research practices to commit yourself to in order to ensure you’re collecting information in an active manner, not a passive manner where a social media feed (YouTube, X, Facebook, etc…) is feeding you what keeps you clicking.\nHow to help others\nHere are a few simple ways to help others be aware of these pitfalls, ask them these questions:\n\nWhere does the person you’re listening to get their information from? Are they open and honest about how they are informed, more than just saying they “read a variety of sources”?\nDoes the person you listen to ever speak to people with opposing views? Not in an insignificant way, but someone who substantively disagrees with them?\nDoes the person you listen to ever break from their party in substantive ways, or do they always fall in line with their “group”?\nDo they make incredibly strong predictions that never seem to come true?\nDo they change their mind on their own, against the grain, or do they only ever seem to change their mind when their group changes their mind?\n"},"Strategy/People’s-Beliefs/Cognitive-Dissonance":{"title":"Cognitive Dissonance","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Strategy/People’s-Beliefs/Constellation-of-Beliefs":{"title":"Constellation of Beliefs","links":["Strategy/People’s-Beliefs/Social-Incentives-Dictate-Beliefs","Strategy/People’s-Beliefs/Healthy-Epistemic-Practice"],"tags":[],"content":"What is it?\nRather than starting from some epistemically humble foundation and individually constructing beliefs, people inherit constellations of beliefs from the social groups they find themselves in, often due to social pressures that push them towards these belief systems. These constellations of beliefs will share some similar, hollow chains of logic, but they are ultimately absorbed at the “applied” level for most people and often have little to no thought put into them before they’re accepted as a person’s own beliefs. These beliefs are always somewhat abstract as well, meaning there is no immediate corrective mechanism that exists in the real world to counter them, as they always make claims that are either just out of our ability to directly perceive them or will come at some point in the future (though they rarely, if ever, manifest).\nThe constellation are also confusing because, upon deeper analysis, almost every stated reason for believing in a particular “star” in a constellation is directly contradicted by the belief itself. Almost all constellations require very high levels (approaching 100%) of ideological congruency insofar as the “important beliefs” are concerned. This means that, upon learning a single belief a person has, it becomes trivial to predict several other beliefs they are likely to have as well.\nExamples\nThe Anti-Establishment Constellation\n\nSupports Donald Trump, believes he will “save America” and maybe the world against the evil establishment, despite the fact that Donald Trump is a billionaire real estate developer from New York City who’s also worked extensively in entertainment.\nOpposed to almost all government organizations, especially anything related to health and intelligence, but will implicitly trust almost anything from a medical journal or “professional” if they happen to already agree with their position, and will almost always believe in other state media, especially enemies to the United States, e.g. Wikileaks, Russia Today, etc…\nBelieves Andrew Tate is a victim of the system, insofar as the charges against him are fake and the girls are coordinating against him with the government, despite the fact that the Tate’s themselves said they moved to Romania to take advantage of their lax laws, and despite the fact that there are hours and hours of the Tate’s on camera admitting to scamming their workers and the men they sell services to.\nBelieves immigration is destroying America because immigrants are either stealing our jobs, leeching our welfare, corrupting the system with their votes or changing the character of our country, despite there being no data to support job theft, no data to show overconsumption of welfare, no data to support they are helping Democrats voting in meaningful ways and no coherent explanation of what the “character of our country” even is.\nDoes not trust the vaccines, thinks COVID was overblown. They will always claim to know someone or know of someone who’s either died to the vaccine or suffered a vaccine injury, or they will deny that COVID was ever a problem at all. There is no data to suggest widespread vaccine injury in any meaningful way, and no one knew what COVID would look like when it first appeared. This same group of people was angered because they felt like COVID was the “cause of death” for every single person who happened to have COVID and die of something, even car accidents, but this same group of people will attribute every single death or illness someone had to a vaccine as long as they were vaccinated.\nDoes not trust any mainstream media, or essentially anyone that has any ties to any mainstream media companies, unless they are reporting something that conforms with their preconceived notions (like the New York Post, a mainstream media company, reporting on the Hunter Biden laptop story). They will claim to trust alternative media over mainstream media, but again, they will source mainstream media when convenient and deny alternative media when it goes against their narrative.\n\nThe Woke Constellation\n\nEverything is seen through the lens of oppression, regardless of any other factors at play. It’s an incredibly socialist, western way of viewing the world, but almost every single conflict will be reduced to oppressor/oppressed dynamics, even if involved parties aren’t saying as much.\nMinorities are not held accountable for anything, there is always some greater reason to explain a behavior by a minority, such as crime, poverty, or any other “ill”, and it is always blamed on a larger group, almost exclusively white people. This might be despite the fact that there are competing explanations and despite the fact that the trend may persist in other areas where the “white oppressor” explanation makes no sense.\nBoth political parties stand for the same thing, which usually just boils down to “not socialism”, so absurd statements like “Bernie Sanders would be a conservative in Europe” are uttered to show the contempt the “woke” people have for the American system not embracing socialism. This is despite a painfully obvious difference in politics between the Republican and Democrat party in the United states.\nAll foreign policy is dictated by whatever opposes United States interests, this applies to every single foreign conflict, even if it means ostensibly supporting Iran, Russia, Hamas or China, even though it seems as though any of those other entities would oppose the “woke” constellation in every single way.\nMinorities cannot be racist towards major power holders, despite using a strictly academic definition of racism (power + prejudice). These people, however, would never concede that you could be racist towards a non-white in another country where they are a majority power holder, and they would never concede that some forms of racism would “become okay” if more power was suddenly held by minority communities in the United States.\nCorporations are always bad, when they invent medications it’s just because they want to withhold them from people for profit, when they support LGBT individuals it’s just “rainbow capitalism”, etc…etc…This is despite the fact that major corporations have enabled almost everything activists do and the ways they communicate with each other, e.g.: iPhones, social media. It’s also strange that labor unions prior to Civil Rights fought so harshly against integration of minorities into the work place, and that worker’s unions today fight against the adoption of green energy to support their workers, yet receive almost no criticism from the “woke” constellation for said actions.\n\nLimitations\nBelonging to “constellations” are bad because the person does essentially no work in arriving at any of their applied positions. It means they will be unable to argue for any of them, so they will be prone to simply attack those who disagree. It also destroys their ability to consider any contrary position, since they arrived at theirs without even considering their own, meaning they will be resistant to accepting new information or changing their beliefs.\nHow to Avoid\nThe easiest way to avoid falling into a constellation is to simply commit yourself to good epistemic practices. Make sure you are arriving at your conclusions by doing independent research, don’t simply believe something someone you like tells you.\nHow to help others\nIt becomes incredibly difficult to break anyone out of any given constellation because there is always some underlying transcendental entity that can explain every single part of why the constellation is true. Even evidence that seems to be in opposition to any particular belief is reinterpreted through the transcendental entity and becomes evidence for the particular belief, so there is absolutely no way to disconfirm the constellation as a whole.\nPerhaps you can try and point out that it seems as though their are underlying explanations to their believe system that can explain literally everything, and ask them what kind of evidence would be disconfirming to their belief.\nExamples of this in relation to the earlier examples given:\n\nThe Anti-Establishment Constellation\n\nThey will claim that they do not trust the mainstream media because it is bought and paid for and a part of the establishment, however they will repeat Tucker Carlson’s words as God, they will repeat Russia Today, a mainstream media outlet from Russia, and they will cite any mainstream media whenever it agrees with a position they have.\nThey will claim that they don’t trust the government because it is also bought and paid for by lobbyists, and because career politicians are inherently corrupt and untrustworthy, but they will never turn that same corrupt eye to Donald Trump, despite him working in heavily government-favored industries like real estate and being the literal president of the United States, and they will trust figures like Rudy Giuliani, despite him being one of the most famous mayors in United States history.\nThey will doubt everything put out by our intelligence agencies, but they will uncritically and enthusiastically cite them when they confirm prior biases, such as our intelligence agencies claiming they believe COVID may indeed have originated from a Chinese lab.\nThe “transcendental entity” at play here is essentially some large, intangible web of actors who seem to simultaneously in control of everything but also unable to prevent some things from getting through, despite them seeming to have the power otherwise. So this entity will be in control of large swaths of society, yet somehow miss things that they seem otherwise easily capable of controlling, e.g. election outcomes, media reports, etc…\n\n\nThe Woke Constellation\n\nThey will claim that all social ills of a particular person can be seen through an oppressive lens, but this will never be applied when the “oppression” could be seen to affect a traditionally unoppressed person, e.g. a white person living in an all black neighborhood, or a white person visiting a foreign country.\nMinorities will be given almost zero agency, and historic oppression will always be given as an excuse for why they are facing a particular problem. This will apply, however, even when there is absolutely no historical oppression, e.g. “black people” are seen as the same thing despite black immigrants from Africa having significantly different lived experiences and social outcomes compared to African Americans.\nBoth political parties will be said to stand for the same thing, but when a socialist appears on the left, and finally gets elected by fails to achieve “socialism” in the US, it’s because the politician either sold out or was crushed by the media/corporations. This might be despite the fact that some even manage to out-raise their non-socialist opponents and lose, like Nina Turner.\nThe “transcendental entity” in play for the Woke people is always some form of oppressive capitalism or White/Straight/Cisexual/Heterosexual male. If good stuff is happening for minorities or LGBT in some corporation, it’s almost because it’s part of some larger insidious plan. If minorities in any part of the world are ever having problems, it is always explained by exploitation, imperialism or colonialism of some sort, even when it’s intra-regional violence, and even when they themselves are the exploiters, imperialists and colonizers.\n\n\n"},"Strategy/People’s-Beliefs/Healthy-Epistemic-Practice":{"title":"Healthy Epistemic Practice","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Researching\nBe Willing to Read\nThere is no shortcut to reading, unfortunately. It can be articles, books, wikipedia entries, news articles, documentaries, whatever; when you read and study something, you develop a fluid vocabulary and working knowledge of the particular thing you are studying. This will help you critically evaluate how trustworthy a particular thing you’re reading is, and will help you weed out good from bad information.\nCheck Your Biases\nDon’t ever fool yourself into thinking you are free of biases. Instead, when you begin reading an article, write down what you are predisposed to believe and who you are predisposed to disagree with. This will ensure that, as you’re reading or listening, you’re aware that you might be primed to agree or disagree with something due to your biases, so you can double check that information just to be sure you’re not falling into a preconceived bias.\nDon’t fall into the pitfall of believing things because they feel good.\nDo your own research, but for real.\nDon’t be selectively skeptical.\nAlways ask yourself what it would take to convince you of the other side.\nAlways be able to argue both sides of an argument, better than anyone else you argue against.\nMatch your conviction with your knowledge.\nDon’t identify your positions with your character, save that for your moral positions.\nMAYBE PEOPLE WHO’S INCENTIVES ARE MIS-ALIGNED (OR CAN’T BE ALIGNED) SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THAT PARTICULAR DECISION MAKING PROCESS, OR HAVING A “RED TEAM” FOR CERTAIN THINGS\n“PRINCIPALED ILLUSIONS” WHERE YOU THINK YOU ALIGN PRINCIPALLY WITH SOMEONE BUT YOU’RE ACTUALLY COMPLETELY MISALIGNED ON EVERY SINGLE APPLIED POSITION\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN THINGS IN HERE THAT YOU MUST CONTROL FOR/BE AWARE OF VS THINGS YOU SHOULD NEVER DO\nECHO CHAMBER\nEPISTEMIC BUBBLE\nBLACK/WHITE THINKING REGARDING AN ENTIRE FIGURE, EVERYTHING IS GOOD OR BAD, EVEN  REWRITING HISTORY TO FIT THE MOLD\nWHEN PEOPLE SAY THINGS THAT ARE OBVIOUSLY PROJECTIONS OR OBVIOUSLY HYPOCRITICAL, IMMEDIATELY SELF-EVIDENTLY SO, ARE THEY AWARE OF WHAT THEY ARE DOING????\nIDEOLOGICAL CONGRUENCY SHOULD VARY BASED ON HOW LOCAL YOUR COMMUNITY IS\nCOMBATTING COGNITIVE DISSONANCE"},"Strategy/People’s-Beliefs/Humans-are-not-Truth-Seeking-Machines":{"title":"Humans are not Truth-Seeking Machines","links":["Strategy/People’s-Beliefs/Cognitive-Dissonance","Strategy/People’s-Beliefs/Healthy-Epistemic-Practice","Strategy/People’s-Beliefs/Social-Incentives-Dictate-Beliefs","Strategy/People’s-Beliefs/Constellation-of-Beliefs"],"tags":[],"content":"What is it?\nHumans treat truth as instrumental, meaning truth is simply (and only) a tool to be utilized to further someone’s personal happiness. This is most obviously seen in the dichotomy of science vs technology, where “science” is an exploration of the universe, and “technology” is the application of that exploration in order to create some useful tool for us to enrich our lives. This is why people highly prefer some forms of science (like medical research, which leads to applications like medicine) and shun other forms of science (like space exploration, where the technological applications can be harder to identify).\nWhen the tool is no longer serving that purpose, it will be abandoned in favor of another tool. In certain domains, especially relating to science, engineering and medicine, the “truth claims” almost always need to adhere closely to reality in order to yield any tangible benefit. It’s not very beneficial for one to believe drinking mercury will cure their disease nor pouring gasoline onto a candle will extinguish the flame, so these beliefs are quickly and immediately dispelled in favor of something that more accurately approaches what is actually true.\nExamples\nThe Internet\nThis is truly the best example of humans seeking pleasure over truth. Decades ago, people joked that with the advent of the internet, almost everyone on the planet would become immediately informed of events and reach very high levels of general awareness and intelligence regarding current events, among other things. We can see today that nothing can be further from the truth. People navigate the internet in a way that appeals to what makes them feel good, and resist searching through areas that produce cognitive dissonance.\nWatching People Research\nIf you have the opportunity to watch someone research for a topic, it can be incredibly eye-opening to see how they search for information and evaluate sources. People will become incredibly skeptical of sources they don’t trust, but all of the skepticism will disappear immediately if it’s a source that is providing them with some type of cognitive consonance.\nLimitations\nThere is nothing wrong with seeking pleasure. Arguably, normativity precedes all epistemic or metaphysical investigation anyway, meaning, we have to make some value statement about truth or the physical world before we can even decide to explore it. The problem, however, is when someone confuses their pleasure-seeking for truth-seeking. People will become confused, assuming their sense and intuitions are naturally leading them to truthful grounds, resulting in them having far more confidence in their beliefs than they should, and preventing them from developing healthy epistemic practices.\nHow to Avoid\nThis pitfall should be easy enough to avoid with some simple introspection. Just realize that your senses did not evolve to convey truth to you, they evolved to help you survive and to help your genes persevere, nothing more. We can easily conceive of times when “lies” may help a person survive, e.g. convincing a person that eating all pork is evil, since much of the meat may be prone to disease. If you have no formal training (a simple philosophy class or media literacy course) in formal thinking, it may be best to find some. Naturally, our minds are not inclined to rational thought, just to identifying patterns (real or imaginary) that further our survival.\nHow to help others\nIt’s important to recognize this because humans who believe their senses naturally and intuitively lead them to “truthful” things rather than “pleasurable” things are likely to confuse the two when there is incentive to believe the truth about a thing. Without any immediate mechanisms to align “truth” with “reality”, people’s understandings can wildly diverge from reality in fantastic ways that lead to catastrophic consequences down the road. Examples of things might be things like vaccine skepticism, climate change denialism, or the mistrust of our voting process. Since these beliefs inherited from our social groups lack any immediately corrective mechanisms, it’s easy for them to fester and manifest in long term negative ways.\nFor friends, one have to simply direct them to engage in healthy epistemic practices. No one wants to be told that the things they believe in are done for selfish reasons. It’s unlikely even if you convince someone that humans are not truth-seeking, they would change their beliefs, as they’d simply agree with you but claim that they are seeking truth while others are simply seeking pleasure."},"Strategy/People’s-Beliefs/Normative-Confusion-with-Applied-Positions":{"title":"Normative Confusion with Applied Positions","links":["Strategy/People’s-Beliefs/Constellation-of-Beliefs","Strategy/People’s-Beliefs/Social-Incentives-Dictate-Beliefs"],"tags":[],"content":"What is it?\nRather than building beliefs from a logical foundation, people tend to inherit constellations of beliefs from their social circles due to misaligned incentives that reward beliefs for social validation rather than factual accuracy. Since there was never any work done to arrive at applied positions through some logic, applied positions are quickly and easily confused with moral positions. This results in people confusing their applied positions with the ethical beliefs they hold.\nExamples\nHere are some examples expressed as syllogisms, where the first proposition is a moral claim, the second proposition claims to remedy an injury to said moral claim, and the conclusion demands that we follow through to cure the morally egregious injury listed in the first proposition.\nFormula:\nP1. Moral injury.\nP2. Something that purports to cure the moral injury.\nC. A demand to follow P2 to cure P1.\nExamples:\nP1. Homelessness should not exist in the United States.\nP2. Free public housing would solve homelessness.\nC. Therefor, we should adopt free public housing.\nP1. Civilians should not be targeted in war.\nP2. A charge of genocide would force Israel to stop killing civilians.\nC. Therefor, we should charge Israel with genocide.\nIn the prior examples, if you disagree with P2, you necessarily disagree with the conclusion, but your interlocutor will assume that you also disagree with P1 as it becomes intrinsically tied to the conclusion since P2 is considered unquestionable. P2 is most likely unquestionable as it is inherited as part of the constellation of beliefs, meaning the individual has done no work to actually investigate P2, nor do they have any incentive to do so.\nThis means that if you disagree that we should adopt public housing, it’s because you believe homelessness should exist in the United states. Or if you believe we shouldn’t charge Israel with genocide, you believe civilians should be targeted in war.\nLimitations\nThis form of irrationality is incredibly destructive due to how quickly someone is to ascribe to you an entire constellation of beliefs, and likely they will ascribe to you all of the same moral reversals as they have in the singular example you’ve disagreed with. It also hurts your own ability to reason through to good applied positions because you very quickly lose your moral compass when you align yourself with only applied positions.\nHere’s an example constellation for someone who’s progressive:\n\nSystemic racism is real, and is the driver of racial inequities\nHealthcare should be free to all\nEducation should be free to all\nTrans rights are unquestionable for all ages\nHousing should not be commodified\nProfit is immoral\n\nAny one of these beliefs could be extracted and expressed in syllogisms as above, and subsequently reversed on you if you disagree with any part of their construction:\nP1. Workers shouldn’t be exploited.\nP2. Eliminating profit would eliminate most worker exploitation.\nC. Profit should be eliminated.\nP1. Everyone is entitled to free healthcare.\nP2. Medicare-for-all would provide free healthcare for everyone.\nC. We should have Medicare-for-all.\nA denial of the second premise on either of these would lead to a denial of the conclusion, but most people would see it as a denial of the first premise.\nHow to Avoid\nAvoiding this pitfall is easy, on paper, but can be difficult, in practice. It’s important to dedicate some time to exploring fundamental moral positions you hold, and then ensuring that your applied positions follow from those moral foundations. If you find that you are constantly accusing others of not having some moral stance simply because they disagree with some policy position, it might be a sign that you’re engaged in some normative confusion, and you need to revisit your fundamental ethical foundations to re-engage with your applied positions.\nHow to help others\nFor others, it might be enough to simply point out that there are other ways of satisfying their fundamental moral positions with different applied positions, but this might be difficult as people often lack fundamental moral positions they’ve thought about and simply inherit their applied positions as part of a constellation of beliefs."},"Strategy/People’s-Beliefs/Skeptics-Rarely-Are":{"title":"Skeptics Rarely Are","links":["Strategy/People’s-Beliefs/Humans-are-not-Truth-Seeking-Machines","Resolving-Cognitive-Dissonance","Strategy/People’s-Beliefs/Constellation-of-Beliefs"],"tags":[],"content":"When individuals become skeptical of a particular thing, it’s not usually because it is failing to live up to some internal rational rubric, it’s usually because it’s failing to satisfy some other personal desire or it’s causing some amount of cognitive dissonance.\nEvidence can be found of this in multiple ways.\n\nSkeptics are rarely skeptical in an even way across multiple entities, e.g. a skeptic might be highly suspicious of something reported by NPR, but will implicitly trust anything reported by RT.\nSkeptics will apply their skepticism selectively across the same class of media entities, e.g. a skeptic will tell you that you can rarely if ever trust the mainstream media, but they will hold onto stories like the Hunter Biden Laptop reporting from the New York Post uncritically as gospel.\nSkeptics will apply their skepticism selectively across the same media entity, e.g. if a particular media entity is reporting something they disagree with, it’s further evidence that the entity is not to be trusted, but as soon as that entity is reporting something they do believe in, that media entity suddenly becomes a worthy source.\nSkeptics almost never move towards an area that requires further investigation or requires a critical re-examination of their own ideas or beliefs, instead they almost always utilize their skepticism to move to areas of greater comfort, e.g. if a report comes out showing an mRNA vaccine as performing well, it’s easy to be skeptical of that report and hold onto the belief that the vaccines don’t work, because this reaffirms our anti-establishment world-view.\n"},"Strategy/People’s-Beliefs/Social-Incentives-Dictate-Beliefs":{"title":"Social Incentives Dictate Beliefs","links":["Strategy/People’s-Beliefs/Humans-are-not-Truth-Seeking-Machines","Strategy/People’s-Beliefs/Constellation-of-Beliefs"],"tags":[],"content":"People rarely apply a consistent, rational formulation for whatever their beliefs are. This is not because people are stupid or lack the ability to do so, but rather because there is little to no incentive for doing so. Truth is simply a means to enrich our lives.

There is great incentive in believing in particular untrue things, especially when there is little practical consequences for having an incorrect understanding of an issue.\nExamples of certain social pressures:\n\nOne might have family members belonging to a certain religion. “Leaving” that belief system might entail being completely disowned by one’s family, which would lead to significant loss of financial and social support.\nOne might have an audience that demands to hear a certain thing, and giving a take counter to what that audience believes might cause one to incur a significant financial or reputational loss.\nOne might belong to social groups in school or on social media that demand adherence to certain sociopolitical beliefs, and betraying those beliefs (or not showing strong support for them) might result in a person being thrown out of said social group.\n\nFor many of the social and political beliefs we hold and value today, being “factually correct” offers little to no reward.

Instead of wiping my entire board, I should remind the person (and the audience) that they failed to respond to the points I’ve made.\nNeed to call out people more who live in stories or anecdotes or unrelated examples/data.\nRestate when a person doesn’t answer a question and move on.\n\nRestate what the other person said and ask them if that was an answer to your question.\n\n\n"},"Strategy/Theory-of-Mind":{"title":"Theory of Mind","links":["Strategy/People’s-Beliefs/Aesthetic-vs-Function","Strategy/People’s-Beliefs/Constellation-of-Beliefs","Strategy/People’s-Beliefs/Humans-are-not-Truth-Seeking-Machines","Strategy/People’s-Beliefs/Normative-Confusion-with-Applied-Positions","Strategy/People’s-Beliefs/Social-Incentives-Dictate-Beliefs","Strategy/People’s-Beliefs/Cognitive-Dissonance","Strategy/People’s-Beliefs/Skeptics-Rarely-Are"],"tags":[],"content":"I’ve spent a great portion of my life arguing with a variety of people across a multitude of environment, so I’m in a unique position to evaluate how people arrive at conclusions and modify their beliefs.
